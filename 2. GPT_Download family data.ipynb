The entire contents of all references cited therein also are expressly incorporated by reference and are intended to be part of the present application. Background of the Invention Fatty acids are carboxylic acids with long-chain hydrocarbon side groups and play a fundamental role in many biological processes. Fatty acids are rarely free in nature but, rather, occur in esterified form as the major component of lipids. Lipids/fatty acids are sources of energy (e.g., b-cxidation) and are an integral part of cell membranes which are indispensable for processing biological or biochemical information. Fatty acids can be divided into two groups: the saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids which contain one or more carbon double bond in  cis- configuration. Unsaturated fatty acids are produced by terminal desaturases that belong to the class of nonheme-iron enzymes. Each of these enzymes are part of a electron-transport system that contains two other proteins, namely cytochrome b 5  and NADH-cytochrome b 5  reductase. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. Human and other mammals have a limited spectrum of these desaturases that are required for the formation of particular double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, humans have to take up some fatty acids through their diet. Such essential fatty acids, for example, are linoleic acid (C18:2); linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4). In contrast, insects and plants are able to synthesize a much larger variety of unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)) are essential components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). For example, over 30% of fatty acids in brain phospholipid are 22:6 (n-3) and 20:4 (n-6). ( Crawford, M.A., et al., (1997) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66:1032S-1041S ). In retina, DHA accounts for more than 60% of the total fatty acids in the rod outer segment, the photosensitive part of the photoreceptor cell. ( Giusto, N.M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391 ). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults ( Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138 ). DHA also has significant effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development ( Giusto, N.M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391 ). In addition, some positive effects of DHA were also found on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers ( Horrocks, L.A. and Yeo, Y.K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215 ). Therefore, the appropriate dietary supply of the fatty acid is important for humans to remain healthy. It is particularly important for infant, young children and senior citizens to adequately intake these fatty acids from the diet since they cannot be efficiently synthesized in their body and must be supplemented by food ( Spector, A.A. (1999) Lipids 34:S1-S3 ). DHA is a fatty acid of the n-3 series according to the location of the last double bond in the methyl end. It is synthesized via alternating steps of desaturation and elongation. Starting with 18:3 (9,12,15), biosynthesis of DHA involves Œî6 desaturation to 18:4 (6,9,12,15), followed by elongation to 20:4 (8,11,14,17).and Œî5 desaturation to 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17). Beyond this point, there are some controversies about the biosynthesis. The conventional view is that 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17) is elongated to 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19) and then converted to 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19) by the final Œî4 desaturation ( Horrobin, D.F. (1992) Prog. Lipid Res. 31:163-194 ). However, Sprecher et al. recently suggested an alternative pathway for DHA biosynthesis, which is independent of Œî4 desaturase, involving two consecutive elongations, a Œî6 desaturation and a two-carbon shortening via limited Œ≤-oxidation in peroxisome ( Sprecher, H., et al. (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36:2471-2477 ;  Sprecher, H., et al. (1999) Lipids 34:S153-S156 ). Production of DHA is important because of its beneficial effect on human health. Currently the major sources of DHA are oils from fish and algae. Fish oil is a major and traditional source for this fatty acid, however, it is usually oxidized by the time it is sold. In addition, the supply of the oil is highly variable and its source is in jeopardy with the shrinking fish populations while the algal source is expensive due to low yield and the high costs of extraction. EPA and AA are both Œî5 essential fatty acids. They form a unique class of food and feed constituents for humans and animals. EPA belongs to the n-3 series with five double bonds in the acyl chain, is found in marine food, and is abundant in oily fish from North Atlantic. AA belongs to the n-6 series with four double bonds. The lack of a double bond in the œâ-3 position confers on AA different properties than those found in EPA. The eicosanoids produced from AA have strong inflammatory and platelet aggregating properties, whereas those derived from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet aggregating properties. AA can be obtained from some foods such as meat, fish, and eggs, but the concentration is low. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is another essential fatty acid found in mammals. GLA is the metabolic intermediate for very long chain n-6 fatty acids and for various active molecules. In mammals, formation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is rate-limited by Œî6 desaturation. Many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, stress, diabetes, eczema, and some infections have been shown to depress the Œî6 desaturation step. In addition; GLA is readily catabolized from the oxidation and rapid cell division associated with certain disorders, e.g., cancer or inflammation. Therefore, dietary supplementation with GLA can reduce the risks of these disorders. Clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation with GLA is effective in treating some pathological conditions such as atopic eczema, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders. The predominant sources of GLA are oils from plants such as evening primrose  (Oenothera biennis),  borage  (Borago officinalis  L.), black currant  (Ribes nigrum),  and from microorganisms such as  Mortierella sp., Mucor sp.,  and  Cyanobacteria.  However, these GLA sources are not ideal for dietary supplementation due to large fluctuations in availability and costs associated with extraction processes. Summary of the Invention The biosynthesis of fatty acids is a major activity of plants and microorganisms. However, humans have a limited capacity for synthesizing essential fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPLTFAs). Biotechnology has long been considered an efficient way to manipulate the process of producing fatty acids in plants and microorganisms. It is cost-effective and renewable with little side effects. Thus, tremendous industrial effort directed to the production of various compounds including speciality fatty acids and pharmaceutical polypeptides through the manipulation of plant, animal, and microorganismal cells has ensued. Accordingly, biotechnology is an attractive route for producing unsaturated fatty acids, especially LCPUFAs, in a safe, cost-efficient manner so as to garner the maximum therapeutic value from these fatty acids. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a family of nucleic acid molecules encoding novel desaturases. In particular, the present inventors have identified the Fad 4 (Œî4 desaturase), Fad5 and Fad5-2 (Œî5 desaturase), and Fad6 (Œî6 desaturase) which are involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6, n-3) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5, n-6); more specifically, Fad4 desaturases 22:5 (n-3) and 22:4 (n-6) resulting in DHA and DPA; Fad5 and Fad5-2 desaturases 20:4 (n-3) and 20:3(n-6) resulting in EPA and AA; and Fad6 desaturases 18:2 (n-6) and 18:3(n-3) resulting in GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) and SDA (stearidonic acid).

In another embodiment, the invention features an isolated nucleic acid molecule that encodes a polypeptide including the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID N0:2,4,6, or 8. In still other embodiments, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules including nucleotide sequences that are substantially identical  (e.g.,  70% identical) to the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3,SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7. The invention further features isolated nucleic acid molecules including at least 30 contiguous nucleotides of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7. In another embodiment; the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a polypeptide including an amino acid sequence that is substantially identical  (e.g.,  50% identical) to the amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. Also featured are nucleic acid molecules which encode allelic variants of the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8.

Also featured are fragments of the full-length polypeptides described herein ( e.g ., fragments including at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues of the sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8) as well as allelic variants of the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In one embodiment, a desaturase polypeptide or fragment thereof has a desaturase activity.

Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention is based; at least in part, on the discovery of novel fatty acid desaturase family members, referred to interchangeably herein as \\\"desaturases\\\" or \\\"desaturase\\\" nucleic acid and protein molecules ( e.g ., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6). These novel molecules are members of the fatty acid desaturase family and are expressed in LCPUFAs-producing organisms,  e.g., Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare, Schizichytrium,  and  Crythecodinium. As used herein, the term \\\"fatty acids\\\" is art recognized and includes a long-chain hydrocarbon based carboxylic acid. Fatty acids are components of many lipids including glycerides. The most common naturally occurring fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids which have an even number of carbon atoms (16 or 18) and which may be saturated or unsaturated. \\\"Unsaturated\\\" fatty acids contain  cis  double bonds between the carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids encompassed by the present invention include, for example, DHA, GLA, and SDA. \\\"Polyunsaturated\\\" fatty acids contain more than one double bond and the double bonds are arranged in a methylene interrupted system (-CH=CH-CH 2 -CH=CH-). Fatty acids are described herein by a numbering system in which the number before the colon indicates the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, whereas the number after the colon is the number of double bonds that are present. In the case of unsaturated fatty acids, this is followed by a number in parentheses that indicates the position of the double bonds. Each number in parenthesis is the lower numbered carbon atom of the two connected by the double bond. For example, oleic acid can be described as 18:1(9) and linoleic acid can be described as 18:2(9, 12) indicating 18 carbons, one double bond at carbon 9, two double bonds at carbons 9 and 12, respectively. The controlling steps in the production of unsaturated fatty acids, i.e., the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, are catalyzed by membrane-associated fatty acid desaturases,  e.g ., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. As used herein, the term \\\"unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway\\\" refers to a series of chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of an unsaturated fatty acid either  in vivo  or  in vitro . Such a pathway includes a series of desaturation and elongation steps which generate unsaturated fatty acids and ultimately, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Such unsaturated fatty acids can include, GLA 18:3 (6,9,12), SDA 18:4 (6,9,12,15), AA 20:4 (5,8,11,14), EPA 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17), and DPA 22:5 (4,7,10,13,16), and DHA 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19). Desaturases can contain a heme-binding motif and/or about three conservative histidine motifs, although additional domains may be present. Members of the fatty acid desaturase family convert saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids,  e.g ., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), which are components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). Examples of LCPLTFA include, among others, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults ( Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138 ). DHA also has effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development ( Giusto, N.M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391 ). In addition, positive effects of DHA were also found in the treatment of diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers ( Horrocks, L.A. and Yeo, Y.K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215 ). Thus, the desaturase molecules can be used to produce the LCPUFAs useful in treating disorders characterized by aberrantly regulated growth, proliferation, or differentiation. Such disorders include cancer,  e.g ., carcinoma, sarcoma, or leukemia; tumor angiogenesis and metastasis; skeletal dysplasia; hepatic disorders; myelodysplastic syndromes; and hematopoietic and/or myeloproliferative disorders. Other disorders related to angiogenesis and which are, therefore, desaturase associated disorders include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. The term \\\"family\\\" when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention is intended to mean two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin or alternatively, can contain homologues of non-human origin,  e.g ., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. For example, the family of desaturase proteins of the present invention comprises one cytochrome b5 heme-binding motif. As used herein, the term \\\"heme-binding motif' is an N-terminal extension of the cytochrome b5-like domain found in front-end desaturases. In another embodiment, members of the desaturase family of proteins include a \\\"histidine motifs\\\" in the protein, preferably, about three or four histidine motifs. As used herein, the term \\\"histidine motif' includes a protein domain having at least about two histidine amino acid residues, preferably about three or four histidine amino acid residues, and is typically found in all microsomal desaturases as the third conservative histidine motif. Examples of cytochrome b5 heme-binding motifs and histidine motifs include amino acid residues 41-44,182-186,216-223, and 453-462 of SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 40-43, 171-175, 207-213, and 375-384 of SEQ ID NO:5, amino acid residues 40-45, 171-176, 208-213,and 395-400 of SEQ ID NO:8, and amino acid residues 42-47, 178-183, 215-220, and 400-405 of SEQ ID NO:11, as shown in Figures 3 and 6. Isolated desaturase proteins of the present invention have an amino acid sequence sufficiently homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 or are encoded by a nucleotide sequence sufficiently homologous to SEQ ID NO:1,3, 5, 7, or 9. As used herein, the term \\\"sufficiently homologous\\\" refers to a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence which contains a sufficient or minimum number of identical or equivalent ( e.g. , an amino acid residue which has a similar side chain) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleotide sequences share common structural domains or motifs and/or a common functional activity. For example, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share common structural domains having at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity across the amino acid sequences of the domains and contain at least one and preferably two structural domains or motifs, are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. Furthermore, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%; 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity and share a common functional activity are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains or motifs: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif and has an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous or identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif, and is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one heme-binding motif and/or at least about three histidine motifs, and has a desaturase activity. As used interchangeably herein, a \\\"desaturase activity,\\\" \\\"biological activity of a desaturase,\\\" or \\\"functional activity of a desaturase,\\\" includes an activity exerted or mediated by a desaturase protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on a desaturase responsive cell or on a desaturase substrate, as determined in vivo or in vitro, according to standard techniques. In one embodiment, a desaturase activity is a direct activity such as an association with a desaturase target molecule. As used herein, a \\\"target molecule\\\" or \\\"binding partner\\\" is a molecule e.g., a molecule involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, with which a desaturase protein binds or interacts in nature such that a desaturase-mediated function is achieved. A desaturase direct activity also includes the formation of a double bond between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule to form an unsaturated fatty acid molecule. The nucleotide sequence of the isolated  Thraustochytrium sp.  Œî4 desaturase, Fad4, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad4 cDNA are shown in Figure 1 and in SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2, respectively. The  Thraustochytrium sp.  Fad4 gene (the open reading frame), which is approximately 1560 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 59.1 kD and which is approximately 519 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the  Thraustochytrium sp.  Œî5 desaturase, Fad5, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5 cDNA are shown in Figure 2 and in SEQ ID NOs:3 and 4, respectively. The  Thraustochytrium sp.  Fad5 gene, which is approximately 1320 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 49.8 kD and which is approximately 439 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the  Pythium irregulare  Œî5 desaturase, Fad5-2, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5-2 cDNA are shown in Figure 4 and in SEQ ID NOs:5 and 6, respectively. The  Pythium irregulare  Fad5-2 gene, which is approximately 1371 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 456 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the  Pythium irregulare  Œî6 desaturase, Fad6, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad6 cDNA are shown in Figure 5 and in SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8, respectively. The  Pythium irregulare  Fad6 gene, which is approximately 1383 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 460 amino acid residues in length. Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections: I. Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode desaturase proteins or biologically active portions thereof, as well as nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify desaturase-encoding nucleic acid molecules ( e . g ., desaturase mRNA) and fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of desaturase nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term \\\"nucleic acid molecule\\\" is intended to include DNA molecules ( e . g ., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules ( e . g ., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. The term \\\"isolated nucleic acid molecule\\\" includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term \\\"isolated\\\" includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an \\\"isolated\\\" nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid ( i.e ., sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated desaturase nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4kb, 3kb, 2kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an \\\"isolated\\\" nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention,  e.g ., a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, or a portion thereof, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information provided herein. Using all or a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, as hybridization probes, desaturase nucleic acid molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques ( e.g.,  as described in  Sambrook, J. et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory ManuaL 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989 ). Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule encompassing all or a portion of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, can be isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed based upon the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A nucleic acid of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to desaturase nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques,  e.g ., using an automated DNA synthesizer. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule consists of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 1,3,5, or 7. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, or a portion of any of these nucleotide sequences. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 is one which is sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that it can hybridize to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1,3,5, or 7, thereby forming a stable duplex. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 ( e . g ., to the entire length of the nucleotide sequence), or a portion or complement of any of these nucleotide sequences. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least (or no greater than) 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-750, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. Moreover, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, a fragment which can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding a portion of a desaturase protein;  e.g ., a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein. The nucleotide sequence determined from the cloning of the desaturase gene allows for the generation of probes and primers designed for use in identifying and/or cloning other desaturase family members, as well as desaturase homologues from other species. The probe/primer ( e.g ., oligonucleotide) typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 12 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 75 consecutive nucleotides of a sense sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, of an anti-sense sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or of a naturally occurring allelic variant or mutant of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Exemplary probes or primers are at least (or no greater than) 12 or 15, 20 or 25,30, 35,40,45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or more nucleotides in length and/or comprise consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein. Also included within the scope of the present invention are probes or primers comprising contiguous or consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein, but for the difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases within the probe or primer sequence. Probes based on the desaturase nucleotide sequences can be used to detect ( e.g ., specifically detect) transcripts or genomic sequences encoding the same or homologous proteins. In preferred embodiments, the probe further comprises a label group attached thereto,  e.g ., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. In another embodiment a set of primers is provided,  e.g ., primers suitable for use in a PCR, which can be used to amplify a selected region of a desaturase sequence,  e.g ., a domain, region, site or other sequence described herein. The primers should be at least 5, 10, or 50 base pairs in length and less than 100, or less than 200, base pairs in length. The primers should be identical, or differ by no greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases when compared to a sequence disclosed herein or to the sequence of a naturally occurring variant. Such probes can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissue which misexpress a desaturase protein, such as by measuring a level of a desaturase-encoding nucleic acid in a sample of cells from a subject,  e.g.,  detecting desaturase mRNA levels or determining whether a genomic desaturase gene has been mutated or deleted. A nucleic acid fragment encoding a \\\"biologically active portion of a desaturase protein\\\" can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1,3,5, or 7, which encodes a polypeptide having a desaturase biological activity (the biological activities of the desaturase proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the desaturase protein ( e.g ., by recombinant expression  in vitro)  and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the desaturase protein. In an exemplary embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and encodes a protein having a desaturase activity (as described herein). The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same desaturase proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs by at least 1, but no greater than 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 amino acid residues from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the amino acid sequence of human desaturase. If an alignment is needed for this comparison, the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. Nucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologues (different locus), and orthologues (different organism) or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product). Allelic variants result, for example, from DNA sequence polymorphisms within a population ( e.g ., the human population) that lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the desaturase proteins. Such genetic polymorphism in the desaturase genes may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. As used herein, the terms \\\"gene\\\" and \\\"recombinant gene\\\" refer to nucleic acid molecules which include an open reading frame encoding a desaturase protein, e.g., oilseed desaturase protein, and can further include non-coding regulatory sequences, and introns. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a naturally occurring allelic variant of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, wherein the nucleic acid molecule hybridizes to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions. Allelic variants of desaturase,  e.g ., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, include both functional and non-functional desaturase proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein that maintain the ability to,  e.g.,  (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule ( e.g ., a fatty acid,  e.g ., DHA); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. The fatty acids produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention are also useful in treating disorders such as aging, stress, diabetes, cancer, inflammatory disorders (e.g., arthritis, eczema), and cardiovascular disorders. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only a conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, 4,6, or 8, or a substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Non-functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein,  e.g.,  Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2; or Fad6, that do not have the ability to,  e.g ., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule ( e.g ., an intermediate fatty acid, such as 18:4 (6,9,12,15)); and/or (ii) forma a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2,4,6, or 8, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. The present invention further provides orthologues ( e.g ., human orthologues of the desaturase proteins). Orthologues of the  Thraustochytrium sp.  and  Pythium irregulare  desaturase proteins are proteins that are isolated from other organisms and possess the same desaturase substrate or target molecule binding mechanisms, double bond forming mechanisms, modulating mechanisms of growth and development of the brain in infants, maintenance mechanisms of normal brain function in adults, ability to affect photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, ability to affect rhodopsin activation, development mechanisms of rods and/or cones, and/or modulating mechanisms of cellular growth and/or proliferation of the non-human desaturase proteins. Orthologues of the  Thraustochytrium sp.  and  Pythium irregulare  desaturase proteins can readily be identified as comprising an amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to SEQ ID NO:2,4, 6, or 8. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other desaturase family members and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, another desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins from different species, and which, thus, have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example,  Schizochytrium  or  Crythecodinium  desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the desaturase cDNAs of the invention can be isolated based on their homology to the desaturase nucleic acids disclosed herein using the cDNAs disclosed herein, or a portion thereof, as a hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent hybridization conditions. Orthologues, homologues and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art ( e.g ., by hybridization to an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions). In one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention is at least 15, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In other embodiment, the nucleic acid is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length. As used herein, the term \\\"hybridizes under stringent conditions\\\" is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences that are significantly identical or homologous to each other remain hybridized to each other. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% identical to each other remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in  Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1995), sections 2, 4, and 6 . Additional stringent conditions can be found in  Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), chapters 7, 9, and 11 . A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4X sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70¬∞C (or alternatively hybridization in 4X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞C) followed by one or more washes in 1X SSC, at about 65-70¬∞C. A preferred, non-limiting example of highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 1X SSC, at about 65-70¬∞C (or alternatively hybridization in 1X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞C) followed by one or more washes in 0.3X SSC, at about 65-70¬∞C. A preferred, non-limiting example of reduced stringency hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4X SSC, at about 50-60¬∞C (or alternatively hybridization in 6X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 40-45¬∞C) followed by one or more washes in 2X SSC, at about 50-60¬∞C. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values,  e.g ., at 65-70¬∞C or at 42-50¬∞C are also intended to be encompassed by the present invention. SSPE (1xSSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 1.25mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1XSSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-10¬∞C less than the melting temperature (T m ) of the hybrid, where T m  is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞C) = 2(# of A + T bases) + 4(# of G + C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞C) = 81.5 + 16.6(log 10 [Na + ]) + 0.41(%G+C)- (600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na + ] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer ([Na + ] for 1X SSC =0.165 M). It will also be recognized by the skilled practitioner that additional reagents may be added to hybridization and/or wash buffers to decrease non-specific hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to membranes, for example, nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, including but not limited to blocking agents ( e . g ., BSA or salmon or herring sperm carrier DNA), detergents ( e . g ., SDS), chelating agents ( e . g ., EDTA), Ficoll, PVP and the like. When using nylon membranes, in particular, an additional preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 0.25-0.5M NaH 2 PO 4 , 7% SDS at about 65¬∞C, followed by one or more washes at 0.02M NaH 2 PO 4 , 1% SDS at 65¬∞C (see  e.g.,   Church and Gilbert (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. USA 81:1991-1995 ), or alternatively 0.2X SSC, 1% SDS. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a \\\"naturally-occurring\\\" nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature ( e.g ., encodes a natural protein). In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of the desaturase sequences that may exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by mutation into the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded desaturase proteins, without altering the functional ability of the desaturase proteins. For example, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at \\\"non-essential\\\" amino acid residues can be made in the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A \\\"non-essential\\\" amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 ( e . g ., the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11) without altering the biological activity, whereas an \\\"essential\\\" amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the desaturase proteins of the present invention,  e.g ., those present in a heme-binding motif or a histidine motif, are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. Furthermore, additional amino acid residues that are conserved between the desaturase proteins of the present invention and other members of the fatty acid desaturase family are not likely to be amenable to alteration. Accordingly; another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such desaturase proteins dif&r in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, yet retain biological activity. In one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, wherein the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% 99% or more homologous to SEQ IDNO: 2,4,6, or 8,  e.g.,  to the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a desaturase protein homologous to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A \\\"conservative amino acid substitution\\\" is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains ( e.g ., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains ( e.g ., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains ( e.g ., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains ( e.g ., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains ( e . g ., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains ( e . g ., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a desaturase protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a desaturase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for desaturase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. In a preferred embodiment, a mutant desaturase protein can be assayed for the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule ( e . g ., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. II. Isolated Desaturase Proteins One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated or recombinant desaturase proteins and polypeptides, and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment, native desaturase proteins can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, desaturase proteins are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a desaturase protein or polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. An \\\"isolated\\\" or \\\"purified\\\" protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the desaturase protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language \\\"substantially free of cellular material\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language \\\"substantially free of cellular material\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, or 30% (by dry weight) of non-desaturase protein (also referred to herein as a \\\"contaminating protein\\\"), more preferably less than about 20% of non-desaturase protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-desaturase protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-desaturase protein When the desaturase protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. The language \\\"substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language \\\"substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals. It should be understood that the proteins or this invention can also be in a form which is different than their corresponding naturally occurring proteins and/or which is still in association with at least some cellular components. For example, the protein can be associated with a cellular membrane. As used herein, a \\\"biologically active portion\\\" of a desaturase protein includes a fragment of a desaturase protein which participates in an interaction between a desaturase molecule and a non-desaturase molecule ( e.g ., a desaturase substrate such as fatty acid). Biologically active portions of a desaturase protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the desaturase amino acid sequences,  e.g ., the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ IDNO:2, 5, 8, or 11 which include sufficient amino acid residues to exhibit at least one activity of a desaturase protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the desaturase protein; the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule ( e.g ., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. A biologically active portion of a desaturase protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600,650,700, 750, 800, 850, 90,0, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200 or more amino acids in length. In one embodiment, a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein comprises a heme-binding motif and/or at least one histidine motifs, preferably about three histidine motifs. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native desaturase protein. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In other embodiments, the desaturase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, yet differs in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. In another embodiment, the desaturase protein is a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In another embodiment, the invention features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. This invention further features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes ( e.g.,  gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the length of the reference sequence ( e.g.,  when aligning a second sequence to the Fad4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2-having 519 amino acid residues, at least 156, preferably at least 208, more preferably at least 260, even more preferably at least 311, and even more preferably at least 363, 415, or 467 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 having 439 amino acid residues, at least 132, preferably at least 176, more preferably at least 220, even more preferably at least 263, and even more preferably at least 307, 351, or 395 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5-2 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 having 456 amino acid residues, at least 137, preferably at least 182, more preferably at least 228, even more preferably at least 273, and even more preferably at least 319, 365, or 419 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad6 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8 having 460 amino acid residues, at least 138, preferably at least 184, more preferably at least 230, even more preferably at least 276, and even more preferably at least 322, 368, or 414 amino acid residues are aligned). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid \\\"identity\\\" is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid \\\"homology\\\"). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the  Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. (48):444-453 (1970 )) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at  http://wwW.gcg.com),  using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14,12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at  http://www.gcg.com),  using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or-80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A preferred, non-limiting example of parameters to be used in conjunction with the GAP program include a Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of  Meyers and Miller (Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:11-17 (1988) ) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2:0 or version 2.0U), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a \\\"query sequence\\\" to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of  Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10 . BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score = 100, wordlength = 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to desaturase nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score = 50, wordlength = 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to desaturase protein molecules of the invention.

When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs ( e.g.,  XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. III. Methods of Producing Unsaturated Fatty Acids The present invention provides new and improved methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids,  e.g ., LCPUFAs, such as, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 (n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 (n-6)), AA (Arachidonic acid, 20:4 (n-6)) and EPA (eicosapentaenioc acid, 20:5(n-3)). A.  Recombinant Cells-and Methods for Culturing Cells The present invention further features recombinant vectors that include nucleic acid sequences that encode the gene products as described herein, preferably Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 gene products. The term recombinant vector includes a vector ( e . g ., plasmid) that has been altered, modified or engineered such that it contains greater, fewer or different nucleic acid sequences than those included in the native vector or plasmid. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector includes the nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one fatty acid desaturase enzyme operably linked to regulatory sequences. The phrase \\\"operably linked to regulatory sequence(s)\\\" means that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression ( e.g ., enhanced, increased, constitutive, basal, attenuated, decreased or repressed expression) of the nucleotide sequence, preferably expression of a gene product encoded by the nucleotide sequence ( e.g ., when the recombinant vector is introduced into a cell). Exemplary vectors are described in further detail herein as well as in, for example, Frascotti  et al.,   U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,137 , the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The term \\\"regulatory sequence\\\" includes nucleic acid sequences which affect ( e.g ., modulate or regulate) expression of other (non-regulatory) nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence is included in a recombinant vector in a similar or identical position and/or orientation relative to a particular gene of interest as is observed for the regulatory sequence and gene of interest as it appears in nature,  e.g ., in a native position and/or orientation. For example, a gene of interest  (e.g.,  a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to the gene in the natural organism  (e.g.,  operably linked to \\\"native\\\" Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequence ( e.g ., to the \\\"native\\\" Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 promoter). Alternatively, a gene of interest ( e.g ., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to another ( e.g ., a different) gene in the natural organism. For example, a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene can be included in a vector operably linked to non-Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequences. Alternatively, a gene of interest ( e.g ., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence from another organism. For example, regulatory sequences from other microbes ( e.g ., other bacterial regulatory sequences, bacteriophage regulatory sequences and the like) can be operably linked to a particular gene of interest. Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers, termination signals and other expression control elements ( e.g ., binding sites for transcriptional and/or translational regulatory proteins, for example, in the transcribed mRNA). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in  Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989 . Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell ( e.g ., constitutive promoters and strong constitutive promoters), those which direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell ( e.g ., inducible promoters, for example, xylose inducible promoters) and those which attenuate or repress expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell ( e.g ., attenuation signals or repressor sequences). It is also within the scope of the present invention to regulate expression of a gene of interest by removing or deleting regulatory sequences. For example, sequences involved in the negative regulation of transcription can be removed such that expression of a gene of interest is enhanced. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes nucleic acid sequences that encode at least one gene product ( e . g ., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) operably linked to a promoter or promoter sequence. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes a terminator sequence or terminator sequences ( e.g ., transcription terminator sequences). The term \\\"terminator sequences\\\" includes regulatory sequences which serve to terminate transcription of mRNA. Terminator sequences (or tandem transcription terminators) can further serve to stabilize mRNA ( e.g ., by adding structure to mRNA), for example, against nucleases. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes antibiotic resistance sequences. The term \\\"antibiotic resistance sequences\\\" includes sequences which promote or confer resistance to antibiotics on the host organism. In one embodiment, the antibiotic resistance sequences are selected from the group consisting of  cat  (chloramphenicol resistance),  tet  (tetracycline resistance) sequences,  erm  (erythromycin resistance) sequences,  neo  (neomycin resistance) sequences and  spec  (spectinomycin resistance)sequences. Recombinant vectors of the present invention can further include homologous recombination sequences ( e.g ., sequences designed to allow recombination of the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host organism). For example,  amyE  sequences can be used as homology targets for recombination into the host chromosome. The term \\\"manipulated cell\\\" includes a cell that has been engineered ( e.g ., genetically engineered) or modified such that the cell has at least one fatty acid desaturase,  e.g ., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6, such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced. Modification or engineering of such microorganisms can be according to any methodology described herein including, but not limited to, deregulation of a biosynthetic pathway and/or overexpression of at least one biosynthetic enzyme. A \\\"manipulated\\\" enzyme ( e.g ., a \\\"manipulated\\\" biosynthetic enzyme) includes an enzyme, the expression or production of which has been altered or modified such that at least one upstream or downstream precursor, substrate or product of the enzyme is altered or modified, for example, as compared to a corresponding wild-type or naturally occurring enzyme. The term \\\"overexpressed\\\" or \\\"overexpression\\\" includes expression of a gene product ( e.g ., a fatty acid desaturase) at a level greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. In one embodiment, the cell can be genetically manipulated ( e.g ., genetically engineered) to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. Genetic manipulation can include, but is not limited to, altering or modifying regulatory sequences or sites associated with expression of a particular gene ( e.g ., by adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or by removing regulatory sequences such that expression is constitutive), modifying the chromosomal location of a particular gene, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to a particular gene such as a ribosome binding site or transcription terminator, increasing the copy number of a particular gene, modifying proteins ( e.g ., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of a particular gene routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). In another embodiment, the cell can be physically or environmentally manipulated to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. For example, a cell can be treated with or cultured in the presence of an agent known or suspected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. Alternatively, a cell can be cultured at a temperature selected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. The term \\\"deregulated\\\" or \\\"deregulation\\\" includes the alteration or modification of at least one gene in a cell that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway, such that the level or activity of the biosynthetic enzyme in the cell is altered or modified. Preferably, at least one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the gene product is enhanced or increased. The phrase \\\"deregulated pathway\\\" can also include a biosynthetic pathway in which more than one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the level or activity of more than one biosynthetic enzyme is altered or modified. The ability to \\\"deregulate\\\" a pathway ( e.g ., to simultaneously deregulate more than one gene in a given biosynthetic pathway) in a cell arises from the particular phenomenon of cells in which more than one enzyme ( e.g ., two or three biosynthetic enzymes) are encoded by genes occurring adjacent to one another on a contiguous piece of genetic material termed an \\\"operon\\\". The term \\\"operon\\\" includes a coordinated unit of gene expression that contains a promoter and possibly a regulatory element associated with one or more, preferably at least two, structural genes ( e.g ., genes encoding enzymes, for example, biosynthetic enzymes). Expression of the structural genes can be coordinately regulated, for example, by regulatory proteins binding to the regulatory element or by anti-termination of transcription. The structural genes can be transcribed to give a single mRNA that encodes all of the structural proteins. Due to the coordinated regulation of genes included in an operon, alteration or modification of the single promoter and/or regulatory element can result in alteration or modification of each gene product encoded by the operon. Alteration or modification of the regulatory element can include, but is not limited to removing the endogenous promoter and/or regulatory element(s), adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or removing regulatory sequences such that expression of the gene products is modified, modifying the chromosomal location of the operon, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the operon or within the operon such as a ribosome binding site, increasing the copy number of the operon, modifying proteins ( e.g ., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of the operon and/or translation of the gene products of the operon, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of genes routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). Deregulation can also involve altering the coding region of one or more genes to yield, for example, an enzyme that is feedback resistant or has a higher or lower specific activity. A particularly preferred \\\"recombinant\\\" cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a plant-derived gene or gene product or an microorganismally-derived gene or gene product. The term \\\"plant-derived,\\\" \\\"microorganismally-derived,\\\" or \\\"derived-from,\\\" for example, includes a gene which is naturally found in a microorganism or a plant,  e . g ., an oilseed plant, or a gene product ( e . g ., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) or which is encoded by a plant gene or a gene from a microorganism ( e.g ., encoded SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ IDNO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7). The methodologies of the present invention feature recombinant cells which overexpress at least one fatty acid desaturase. In one embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a  Thrauschytrium sp.  fatty acid desaturase ( e.g ., has been engineered to overexpress at least one of  Thrauschytrium sp.  Œî4 or Œî5 desaturase (the Fad4. or Fad5 gene product). ( e.g ., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or 4 or encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3). In another embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a  Pythium irregulare  Œî5 or Œî6 desaturase (the Fad5-2 or Fad6 gene product) ( e.g ., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8 or encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID-NO:5 or 5). In another embodiment, the invention features a cell ( e.g ., a microbial cell) that has been transformed with a vector comprising a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence ( e.g ., a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7). Another aspect of the present invention features a method of modulating the production of fatty acids comprising culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention ( e.g ., a desaturase) such that modulation of fatty acid production occurs ( e.g ., production of unsaturated fatty acids is enhanced). The method of culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention ( e.g .,Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6) to modulate the production of fatty acids is referred to herein as \\\"biotransformation.\\\" The biotransformation processes can utilize recombinant cells and/or desaturases described herein. The term \\\"biotransformation process,\\\" also referred to herein as \\\"bioconversion processes,\\\" includes biological processes which result in the production ( e.g ., transformation or conversion) of any compound ( e.g ., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is upstream of a fatty acid desaturase to a compound ( e.g ., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is downstream of a fatty acid desaturase, in particular, an unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of an unsaturated fatty acid comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses at least one fatty acid desaturase with at least one appropriate substrate under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced and, optionally, recovering the fatty acid. In a preferred embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of unsaturated fatty acids comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 with an appropriate substrate ( e.g ., an intermediate fatty acid) under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid ( e.g ., DHA, SDA, or GLA) is produced and, optionally, recovering the unsaturated fatty acid. Conditions under which an unsaturated fatty acid is produced can include any conditions which result in the desired production of an unsaturated fatty acid. The cell(s) and/or enzymes used in the biotransformation reactions are in a form allowing them to perform their intended function ( e.g ., producing a desired fatty acids). The cells can be whole cells, or can be only those portions of the cells necessary to obtain the desired end result. The cells can be suspended ( e.g ., in an appropriate solution such as buffered solutions or media), rinsed ( e . g ., rinsed free of media from culturing the cell), acetone-dried, immobilized ( e . g ., with polyacrylamide gel or k-carrageenan or on synthetic supports, for example, beads, matrices and the like); fixed, cross-linked or permeablized ( e . g ., have permeablized membranes and/or walls such that compounds, for example, substrates, intermediates or products can more easily pass through said membrane or wall). The type of cell can be any cell capable of being used within the methods of the invention,  e . g ., plant, animal, or microbial cells. An important aspect of the present invention involves growing the recombinant plant or culturing the recombinant microorganisms described herein, such that a desired compound ( e.g ., a desired unsaturated fatty acid) is produced. The term \\\"culturing\\\" includes maintaining and/or growing a living microorganism of the present invention ( e.g ., maintaining and/or growing a culture or strain). In one embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in liquid media. In another embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in solid media or semi-solid media. In a preferred embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in media ( e.g ., a sterile, liquid media) comprising nutrients essential or beneficial to the maintenance and/or growth of the microorganism ( e.g ., carbon sources or carbon substrate, for example complex carbohydrates such as bean or grain meal, starches, sugars, sugar alcohols, hydrocarbons, oils, fats, fatty acids, organic acids and alcohols; nitrogen sources, for example, vegetable proteins, peptones, peptides and amino acids derived from grains, beans and tubers, proteins, peptides and amino acids derived form animal sources such as meat, milk and animal byproducts such as peptones, meat extracts and casein hydrolysates; inorganic nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate; phosphorus sources, for example, phosphoric acid, sodium and potassium salts thereof; trace elements, for example, magnesium, iron, manganese, calcium, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum, and/or cobalt salts; as well as growth factors such as amino acids, vitamins, growth promoters and the like). Preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled pH. The term \\\"controlled pH\\\" includes any pH which results in production of the desired product ( e . g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of about 7. In another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.5. The desired pH may be maintained by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art. Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled aeration. The term \\\"controlled aeration\\\" includes sufficient aeration ( e.g ., oxygen) to result in production of the desired product ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, aeration is controlled by regulating oxygen levels in the culture, for example, by regulating the amount of oxygen dissolved in culture media. Preferably, aeration of the culture is controlled by agitating the culture. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the growth vessel ( e.g ., fermentor) or by various pumping equipment. Aeration may be further controlled by the passage of sterile air or oxygen through the medium (e.g., through the fermentation mixture). Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured without excess foaming ( e.g .,  via  addition of antifoaming agents). Moreover, plants or microorganisms of the present invention can be cultured under controlled temperatures. The term \\\"controlled temperature\\\" includes any temperature which results in production of the desired product ( e . g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞C and 95¬∞C. In another embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞C and 70¬∞C. Preferred temperatures are between 20¬∞C and 55¬∞C, more preferably between 30¬∞C and 45¬∞C or between 30¬∞C and 50¬∞C. Microorganisms can be cultured ( e . g ., maintained and/or grown) in liquid media and preferably are cultured, either continuously or intermittently, by conventional culturing methods such as standing culture, test tube culture, shaking culture ( e . g ., rotary shaking culture, shake flask culture, etc.), aeration spinner culture, or fermentation. In a preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in shake flasks. In a more preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in a fermentor ( e.g ., a, fermentation process). Fermentation processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, batch, fed-batch and continuous methods of fermentation. The phrase \\\"batch process\\\" or \\\"batch fermentation\\\" refers to a closed system in which the composition of media, nutrients, supplemental additives and the like is set at the beginning of the fermentation and not subject to alteration during the fermentation, however, attempts may be made to control such factors as pH and oxygen concentration to prevent excess media acidification and/or microorganism death. The phrase \\\"fed-batch process\\\" or \\\"fed-batch\\\" fermentation refers to a batch fermentation with the exception that one or more substrates or supplements are added ( e.g ., added in increments or continuously) as the fermentation progresses. The phrase \\\"continuous process\\\" or \\\"continuous fermentation\\\" refers to a system in which a defined fermentation media is added continuously to a fermentor and an equal amount of used or \\\"conditioned\\\" media is simultaneously removed, preferably for recovery of the desired product ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). A variety of such processes have been developed and are well-known in the art. The phrase \\\"culturing under conditions such that a desired compound ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid, for example, DHA) is produced\\\" includes maintaining and/or growing plants or microorganisms under conditions ( e.g ., temperature, pressure, pH, duration, etc.) appropriate or sufficient to obtain production of the desired compound or to obtain desired yields of the particular compound being produced. For example, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to produce the desired amount of a unsaturated fatty acid ( e . g ., DHA). Preferably, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to substantially reach maximal production of the unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, culturing is continued for about 12 to 24 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for about 24 to 36 hours, 36 to 48 hours, 48 to 72 hours, 72 to 96 hours, 96 to 120 hours, 120 to 144 hours, or greater than 144 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to reach production yields of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, cells are cultured such that at least about 15 to 20 g/L of unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 20 to 25 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 25 to 30 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 30 to 35 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 35 to 40 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced ( e.g ., at least about 37 g/L unsaturated fatty acids) or at least about 40 to 50 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced. In yet another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured under conditions such that a preferred yield of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, a yield within a range set forth above, is produced in about 24 hours, in about 36 hours, in about 48 hours, in about 72 hours, or in about 96 hours. In producing unsaturated fatty acids, it may further be desirable to culture cells of the present invention in the presence of supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates. The term \\\"supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrate\\\" includes an agent or compound which, when brought into contact with a cell or included in the culture medium of a cell, serves to enhance or increase unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added in the form of a concentrated solution or suspension ( e.g ., in a suitable solvent such as water or buffer) or in the form of a solid ( e.g ., in the form of a powder). Moreover, supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added as a single aliquot, continuously or intermittently over a given period of time. The methodology of the present invention can further include a step of recovering a desired compound ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). The term \\\"recovering\\\" a desired compound includes extracting, harvesting, isolating or purifying the compound from culture media. Recovering the compound can be performed according to any conventional isolation or purification methodology known in the art including, but not limited to, treatment with a conventional resin ( e . g ., anion or cation exchange resin, nonionic adsorption resin, etc.), treatment with a conventional adsorbent ( e.g ., activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina, etc.), alteration of pH, solvent extraction ( e.g ., with a conventional solvent such as an alcohol, ethyl acetate, hexane and the like), dialysis, filtration, concentration crystallization, recrystallization, pH adjustment, lyophilization and the like. For example, a compound can be recovered from culture media by first removing the microorganisms from the culture. Media is then passed through or over a cation exchange resin to remove unwanted cations and then through or over an anion exchange resin to remove unwanted inorganic anions and organic acids having stronger acidities than the unsaturated fatty acid of interest ( e.g ., DHA). Preferably, a desired compound of the present invention is \\\"extracted,\\\" \\\"isolated\\\" or \\\"purified\\\" such that the resulting preparation is substantially free of other components ( e . g ., free of media components and/or fermentation byproducts). The language \\\"substantially free of other components\\\" includes preparations of desired compound in which the compound is separated ( e.g ., purified or partially purified) from media components or fermentation byproducts of the culture from which it is produced. In one embodiment, the preparation has greater than about 80% (by dry weight) of the desired compound ( e.g ., less than about 20% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), more preferably greater than about 90% of the desired compound ( e.g ., less than about 10% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), still more preferably greater than about 95% of the desired compound ( e.g ., less than about 5% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), and most preferably greater than about 98-99% desired compound ( e.g ., less than about 1-2% other media components or fermentation byproducts). When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to a salt, the compound is preferably further free ( e.g ., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the salt. When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to an alcohol, the compound is preferably further free ( e.g ., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the alcohol. In an alternative embodiment, the desired unsaturated fatty acid is not purified from the plant or microorganism, for example, when the plant or microorganism is biologically non-hazardous ( e.g ., safe). For example, the entire plant or culture (or culture supernatant) can be used as a source of product ( e.g ., crude product). In one embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) supernatant is used without modification. In another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is concentrated. In yet another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is pulverized, dried, or lyophilized. B. High Yield Production Methodologies A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention is a high yield production method for producing unsaturated fatty acids,  e.g ., DHA, comprising culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that the unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a significantly high yield. The phrase \\\"high yield production method,\\\" for example, a high yield production method for producing a desired compound ( e.g ., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) includes a method that results in production of the desired compound at a level which is elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods. Preferably, a high yield production method results in production of the desired compound at a significantly high yield. The phrase \\\"significantly high yield\\\" includes a level of production or yield which is sufficiently elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods, for example, which is elevated to a level sufficient for commercial production of the desired product ( e . g ., production of the product at a commercially feasible cost). In one embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 2 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 10 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 20 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 40 g/L. The invention further features a high yield production method for producing a desired compound ( e . g ., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) that involves culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that a sufficiently elevated level of compound is produced within a commercially desirable period of time. In an exemplary embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 15-20 g/L in 36 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 25-30 g/L in 48 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 35-40 g/L in 72 hours, for example, greater that 37 g/L in 72 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30-40 g/L in 60 hours, for example, greater that 30, 35 or 40 g/L in 60 hours. Values and ranges included and/or intermediate within the ranges set forth herein are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention. For example, unsaturated fatty acid production at levels of at least 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 g/L in 60 hours are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. In another example, ranges of 30-35 g/L or 35-40 g/L are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. Moreover, the skilled artisan will appreciate that culturing a manipulated microorganism to achieve a production level of, for example, \\\"30-40 g/L in 60 hours\\\" includes culturing the microorganism for additional time periods ( e . g ., time periods longer than 60 hours), optionally resulting in even higher yields of an unsaturated fatty acid being produced. IV. Compositions The desaturase nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and fragments thereof, of the invention can be used to produce unsaturated fatty acids which can be incorporated into compositions. Compositions of the present invention include,  e.g ., compositions for use as animal feed, compositions for use as neutraceuticals ( e.g ., dietary supplements), and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise an unsaturated fatty acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language \\\"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\\\" is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents; isotonic and absorption delaying-agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral,  e.g ., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral ( e.g .; inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL ‚Ñ¢  (BASF, Parsippany, NJ) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases; the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound ( e.g ., a LCPUFA, or a fragment thereof, produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant,  e.g ., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories ( e . g ., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in  U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811 . It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals,  e . g ., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 ( i.e ., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide ( i.e ., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with a LCPUFA in the range of between about 0. 1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody, protein, or polypeptide used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent from the results of diagnostic assays as described herein. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the figures, are incorporated herein by reference. EXAMPLES Materials:   Thraustochytrium s.p  ATCC 21685 and  Pythium irregulare  were purchased from American type culture collection (12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland, 20852 USA) and grown in a medium ( Weete, J.D.,et al. (1997) Lipids 32:839-845 ) at 24¬∞C for 7days. After then biomass were harvested by centrifugation and used for RNA isolation. EXAMPLE 1: CONSTRUCTION AND SCREENING OF cDNA LIBRARY Total RNA was isolated from the above materials according to Qiu and Erickson ( Qiu, X. and Erickson, L. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. Repr: 12:209-214 ). The cDNA library was constructed from the total RNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase from Gibco-BRL. The second strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I from Stratagene. After size fractionation, cDNA inserts larger than I kb were ligated into Œª Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene). The recombinant ~ DNAs were then packed with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) and plated on NZY plates. The resulting library represented more than 5 x 106 independent clones. Screening of the cDNA library was performed according to standard methods ( Sambrook, J, Fritseh, E.F Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular cloning - A laboratory manual. (Cold Spring Harbor, New York, USA .) EXAMPLE 2: RT-PCR The single strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) from total RNA and was then used as the template for PCR reaction with two degenerate primers (The forward primer: \\nGCXCA/GAXGAXCAC/TCCXGGXGG and the reverse primer: \\nATXTG/TXGGA/GAAXAG/AG/ATGG/ATG). The PCR amplification consisted of 35 cycles with 1 min at 94¬∞ C, 1.5 min at 55 ¬∞C and 2 min at 72 ¬∞C followed by an extension step at 72 ¬∞C for 10 min. The amplified products from 800 bp to 1000 bp were isolated from agarose gel and purified by a kit (Qiaex II gel purification, Qiagen), and subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR ¬Æ 2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were then sequenced by PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). EXAMPLE 3: EXPRESSION OF FAD4, FAD5, FAD5-2, AND FAD6 IN YEAST The open reading frames of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 were amplified by PCR using the Precision Plus enzyme (Stratagene) and cloned into a. TA cloning vector (pCR ¬Æ 2.1, Invitrogen). Having confirmed that the PCR products were identical to the original cDNAs by sequencing, the fragments were then released by a BarnHI-EcoRI double digestion and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the inducible promoter  GAL1. Yeast strains InvSc2 (Invitrogen) was transformed with the expression constructs using the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil ( Gietz, D., et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20:1425 ;  Covello, P.S. and Reed, D.W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226 ). Transformants were first grown in minimal medium lacking uracil and containing glucose at 28¬∞C. After overnight culture, the cells were spun down, washed and resuspended in distilled water. Minimal medium containing 2% galactose, with or without 0.3 mM substrate fatty acids in the presence of 0.1 % tergitol, was inoculated with the yeast transformant cell suspension and incubated at 20¬∞C for three days, and then 15 ¬∞C for another three days. EXAMPLE 4: FATTY ACID ANALYSIS Thraustochytrium,  Pythium irregulare  and yeast cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water. Then 2 mL methanolic KOH (7.5% w/v KOH in 95% methanol) was added to the materials and the mixture sealed in a 12 ml glass culture tube was heated to 80¬∞C for 2 hours. 0.5 mL water was added and the sample was extracted twice with 2 mL hexane to remove the non-saponifiable lipids. The remaining aqueous phase was then acidified by adding 1 mL 6 N HCl and extracted twice with 2 mL hexane. The hexane phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. 2 mL 3 N methanolic HCl (SUPELCO, Supelco Park, Bellefonte, PA 16823-0048) was added and the mixture was heated at 80¬∞C for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL 0.9% NaCl was added and the mixture extracted twice with 2 x 2 mL hexane. The combined hexane was evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS according to Covello & Reed ( Covello, P.S. and Reed, D.W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226 ). GC/MS analysis was performed in standard EI mode using a Fisons VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, UK) controlled by Masslynx version 2.0 software, coupled to a GC 8000 Series gas chromatograph. A DB-23 column (30M x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 Ilm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) that was temperature-programmed at 180 ¬∞C for 1 min, then 4 C /min to 240 ¬∞C and held for 15 minutes, was used for FAME analysis. EXAMPLE 5: TRANSFORMATION OF BRASSICA JUNCEA AND FLAX (LINUM USITATISSIMUM) AND EXOGENOUS FATTY ACID TREATMENT The hypocotyls of 5-6 day seedlings of  B. juncea  and flax were used as explants for inoculation with the  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  that hosts binary vectors with the full-length cDNAs under the control of the different promoters. The 20-day transgenic seedlings were used for exogenous fatty acid treatment. The seedling was divided into three parts: leaves, stems and roots. Each was cut into the small pieces and placed in a 24-well titer plate. To each well, 2 mL 0.05% sodium salt of substrates (NuCheck Prep Inc., Elysian, MN) was added. The plate was then incubated at 24¬∞C for 4 h with gentle shaking. After incubation, the plant tissues were washed three times with water and then used for fatty acid analysis. EXAMPLE 6: FATTY ACID PROFILE OF THE  THRAUSCHTRIUM SP . Thraustochytrium and  Pythium irregulare  have recently drawn scientific attention due to its ability in production of LCPUFAs such as DHA, AA, EPA and DPA. Figures 15 and 16 show the fatty acid composition of the lipids isolated from 7 day cultures of  Thraustochytrium sp.  and  Pythium irregulare,  respectively. As shown in the tables, the microorganisms contain a broad range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from both n-3 and n-6 families, from 1 8-carbon A6 fatty acids (gamma-linolenic acid and steardonic acid) to 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids (DHA and DPA). The organisms, especially  Thraustochytrium sp.,  appear to contain a full-set of desaturation and elongation enzymes required for the DHA and DPA biosynthesis. The strain lacks 24-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, the proposed precursors for DHA and DPA synthesis in Precher' s pathway ( Voss, A., et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:19995-20000 ;  Mohammed, B.S., et al. (1997) Biochem. J. 326:425-430 ). The 24-carbon fatty acid may not be involved in  in vivo  synthesis of 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids such as DHA and DPA in  Thraustochytrium sp . EXAMPLE 7: IDENTIFICATION OF cDNAs CODING FOR THE \\\"FRONT-END\\\" DESATURASE To identify genes coding for desaturases involved in biosynthesis of LCFUFAs in  Thraustochytrium sp . and  Pythium irregulare,  a PCR-based cloning strategy was adopted. Two degenerate primers are designed to target the heme-binding motif of N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in front-end desaturases and the third conservative histidine motif in all microsomal desaturases, respectively. The rational behind the design is that the desaturases involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis in  Thraustochytrium sp.  and  Pythium irregulare,  should have similar primary structure as other front-end desaturases, i.e. N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in the desaturase. Four cDNAs fragments were identified from  Thraustochytrium sp.  and  Pythium irregulare  that encode fusion proteins containing cyt b5-like domain in the N-terminus. To isolate full-length cDNA clones, the four inserts were used as probes to screen cDNA libraries of  Thraustochytrium sp.  and  Pythium irregulare ; which resulted in identification of several cDNA clones in each group. Sequencing of all those clones identified four full-length cDNAs which were named as Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2 and Fad6. The open reading frame of Fad4 is 1560 bp and codes for 519 amino acids with molecular weight of 59.1 kDa (Figure 1). Fad5 is 1230 bp in length and codes for 439 amino acids with molecular weight of 49.8 kDa (Figure 2). A sequence comparison of these two sequences from  Thraustochytrium sp . showed only 16% amino acid identity between the deduced proteins. A detailed analysis revealed that Fad4 is 80 amino acids. longer than Fad5, occurring between the second and third conservative histidine motifs (Figure 3). The open reading frame of Fad5-2 from  Pythium irregulare  is 1371 bp and codes for 456 amino acids (Figure 4). Fad6 from  Pythium irregulare  is 1383 bp in length and codes for 460 amino acids (Figure 5). Sequence comparison of the two sequences from  Pythium irregulare  showed over 39% similarity between the deduced proteins (Figure 6). A BLASTP ‚Ñ¢  search of the protein database revealed the following hits for each of the four proteins, Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6: \\n Fad 4  (519 amino acid residues) \\n Blastp nr \\n TABLE-tabl0001 Accession No. Organism Description Length % Identity AF067654 Mortierella alpina Œî5 fatty acid desaturase 509 29 AF054824 Mortierella alpina Œî 5 microsomal desaturase 509 28 AB022097 Dictyostelium discoideum Œî5 fatty acid desaturase 507 27 AB029311 Dictyostelium discoideum fatty acid desaturase 519 26 L11421 \\nD90914 Synechocystis sp.

Figure 7 shows that with supplementation of the medium with 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19), yeast cells containing  Fad4  cDNA had an extra fatty acid as compared to the vector control. The peak has a retention time identical to the DHA standard. LC/MS analysis of the free fatty acid showed that it yields deprotonated molecular ions (m/z = 279) identical to the DHA standard in negative ion electrospray. Moreover, GC/MS analysis of the FAME confirmed that the spectrum of the peak is identical to that of the DHA standard (Figure 8). These results indicate that Fad4 is a Œî4 fatty acid desaturase which is able to introduce a double bond at position 4 of the 22:5(7,10,13,16,19) substrate, resulting in a Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DHA (22:6-4,7,10,13,16,19). To further study the substrate specificity of the Fad4, a number of substrates including 18:2(9,12), 18:3(9,12,15), 20:3(8,11,14) and 22:4(7,10,13,16) were separately supplied to the yeast transformants. The results indicated Fad4 could also use 22:4 (7,10,13,16) as a substrate (Figure 9) to produce another Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DPA (22:5-4,7,10,13,16) (Figure 10). The rest of the fatty acids examined were not effective substrates. To confirm the function of  Fad5  and  Fad5-2,  the  S. cerevisiae  Invsc2 was transformed with plasmids, which contain the open reading frame of the  Fad5  and  Fad5-2  respectively under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter. When the yeast transformants were induced by galactose in a medium containing homo-gamma-linolenic acid (HGLA, 20:3-8,11,14), an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control (Figure 11). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the fatty acid had a retention time identical to the arachidonic acid standard (AA, 20:4-5,8,11,14). To further confirm the regiochemistry of the products, the FAMEs were analyzed by GCIMS. Figure 12 indicates that the mass spectra of the new fatty acid and the AA standard are identical. These results demonstrate that Fad5 and Fad5-2 convert HGLA (20:3-8,11,13) into AA (20:4-5,8,11,14) in yeast. To further study the substrate specificity of Fad5-2, the plasmid containing  Fad5-2  was transferred into another yeast strain AMY-2Œ± where ole1, a Œî9 desaturase gene, is disrupted. The strain is unable to grow in minimal media without supplementation with mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In this experiment, the strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 17:1(10 Z ), a non-substrate of Fad5-2, which enabled study of the specificity of the enzyme towards various substrates, especially monounsaturates. A number of possible substrates including 16:1(9 Z ), 18:1(9 Z ), 18:1(11 Z ), 18:1(11 E ), 18:1(12 E ), 18:1(15 Z ), 18:2(9 Z ,12 Z ), 18:3(9 Z ,12 Z ,15 Z ), 20:2(11 Z ,14 Z ) and 20:3(11 Z ,14 Z ,17 Z ) were tested. Results indicated that Fad5-2 could desaturate unsaturated fatty acids with Œî9 ethylenic and Œî11 ethylenic double bonds, as well as the fatty acid with Œî8 ethylenic double bond (20:3-8,11,14). As shown in Figure 13, Fad5-2 effectively converted both 18:1(9Z) and 18:1(11Z) substrates into their corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids, 18:2-5,9 (the retention time 10.34 min) and 18:1=5,11 (the retention time 10.44 min), respectively. Fad5-2 also desaturated  trans  fatty acid such as 18:1(11 E ) and 18:1(12 E ). Figure 25 is a comparison of substrate preference of Fad5-2 for fatty acid substrates tested in the yeast strain AMY-2Œ±. The relative proportions of the substrates and the products accumulated are a useful indicator of substrate preference of the enzyme. As shown in Figure 25, Fad5-2 prefers fatty acids with 20-carbon as substrates, such as 20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z), 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) and 20:2(11Z,14Z). Whereas, the shorter chain fatty acid is a relatively weaker substrate for the enzyme in yeast. To confirm the function of Fad6, the  S .  cerevisiae  host strain Invsc2 was transformed with a plasmid containing the open reading frame of Fad6 under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter, GAL1. When the yeast transformant was induced by galactose in a medium containing linoleic acid, an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of the FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control (Figure 14). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the peak had a retention time identical to the gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3-6,9,12) standard. To confirm the regioselectivity of the products, the diethylamine derivatives of fatty acids from the expressing strain were analyzed by GC-MS. Figure 15 shows that the new peak is indeed GLA with three double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions. Major fragments of n and n+1 carbons differing by 12 D are diagnostic of a double bond between carbon n+1 and n+2. Thus, the fragments at 156 and 168, 196 and 208, and 236 and 248, indicate double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions, respectively. These results demonstrate that Fad6 is a Œî6 desaturase that converts linoleic acid (18:2) to GLA in yeast. EXAMPLE 9: EXPRESSION OF FAD4 IN  B. JUNCEA To determine whether  Traustochytrium  Fad4 is functional in oilseed crops,  B. juncea  were transformed with the construct containing Fad4 under the control of a constitutive promoter. Eight independent transgenic plants were obtained. In  B .  juncea  there is no Œî4 fatty acid desaturase substrates available. Thus, to examine the activity of the transgenic enzyme in the plants, the 22:5 (n-3) substrate must be exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium docosapentaeneate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of both types of plants, but converted into DHA only in transgenics. Leaves have a higher level of production of DHA than roots and stems. In leaves, the exogenous substrate was incorporated to a level of 10-20% of the total fatty acids and Œî4 desaturated fatty acid (22:6, n-3) was produced in a range of 3-6% of the total fatty acids (Figure 16). These results indicate that the Œî4 fatty acid desaturase from  Traustochytrium  is functional in oilseed crops. EXAMPLE 10: EXPRESSION OF FAD5-2 IN  B. JUNCEA To determine whether Fad5-2 is functional in oilseed crops and its expression has any effect on their growth and development,  B. juncea  were transformed with a binary vector that contained Fad5-2 cDNA behind a constitutive promoter (a tandem cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter). Six independent primary transgenic plants were obtained and the fatty acid profile of lipids from different tissues was determined. Figure 17 shows the fatty acid composition of three-week-old seedling plants from one T 1  line. Compared with wild type, all transgenic plant tissues have an altered fatty acid profile containing four additional peaks which were identified as four different Œî5-undesaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids (Œî5-UPIFAs), specifically, taxoleic (18:2-5,9); ephedrenic (18:2-5,11); pinolenic (18:3-5,9,12), and coniferonic acids (18:4-5,9,12,15). Thus  B. juncea,  like yeast, can functionally express the  P. irregulare  Œî5 desaturase to convert the endogenous substrates 18:1-9; 18:1-11; 18:2-9,12, and 18:3-9,12,15 to the corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids. The roots produced the highest amount of the Œî5-UPIFAs, representing more than 20% of the total fatty acids, followed by 6% in stems and 5% in leaves (Figure 17). In  B. juncea  there is no homo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3-8,11,14) substrate available. Thus, to examine whether the transgenic plant can produce AA, the substrate 20:3(8,11,14) was exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium homo-gamma-linolenate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of transgenic plants and converted into AA in plants (Figure 18). There was no observable phenotypic effect on the growth and development in the transgenic  B. juncea,  although the Œî5-UPIFAs accumulated in all parts of the plant Growth and differentiation of vegetative tissues such as the leaves, stems, and roots were indistinguishable from the corresponding wild type. To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in seeds,  B. juncea  were transformed with the construct containing  Fad5-2  cDNA behind a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus  napin promoter). Fatty acid analysis of transgenic seeds showed that there were two new fatty acids appearing in the gas chromatogram of transgenics compared with the wild type control (Figure 19). They were identified as taxoleic acid (18:2-5,9) and pinolenic acids (18:3-5,9,12). Together, these fatty acids represent 9.4 % of the seed fatty acids. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs has no significant effect on the oleic acid content compared with the untransformed control. EXAMPLE 11: EXPRESSION OF FAD5-2 IN FLAX To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, flax was transformed: with  Fad5-2  under the control of two seed-specific promoters, a heterologous  B. napus  napin promoter, and a flax endogenous promoter. As shown in Figure 26, transgenic plants containing the napin promoter produced one Œî5 desaturated fatty acid, taxoleic acid in seeds at the level of less than 1% of the total fatty acids. Whereas transgenic plants containing the flax seed-specific promoter produced three Œî5 desaturated fatty acids: taxoleic, pinolenic, and coniferonic acid. Of these, taxoleic (18:2-5,9) was the most abundant and accounted for more than 9% of the total fatty acids in a elite line (FN-10-1), followed by coniferonic and pinolenic acids. Surprisingly, accumulation of Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in transgenic seeds has significant impact on the composition of other fatty acids, especially the oleic acid level. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs was accompanied by a huge increase of the oleic acids in both types of transgenic plants expressing Fad5-2 desaturase under the control of the different promoters. The content of oleic acid in transgenic plants with the napin and flax seed-specific promoters, on the average, reached 44.7% and 24.3% of the total fatty acids, respectively, relative to the untransformed control at 17.4%. EXAMPLE 12: EXPRESSION OF FAD6 IN FLAX To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, two types of flax were transformed with the construct that contains Fad6 cDNA under the control of a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus  napin promoter). Type I flax (Normandy) is a traditional industrial oilseed crop, whereas Type II (Solin) is an edible oilseed crop derived from chemical mutagenesis of Type I. A total of twelve transgenic plants were produced. The majority of transgenics exhibited two novel fatty acids whose retention times correspond to GLA and SDA and they constitute 0.1 to 4.3 % of the total fatty acids (Figure 27). The level of GLA in transgenic Solin type is higher than that of SDA, while GLA in transgenic Normandy is lower than SDA. This is understandable because linoleic acid is a major fatty acid in Solin type linseed while Œ±-linolenic acid is a major fatty acid in Normandy seeds. EXAMPLE 13: EXPRESSION OF FAD6 IN  B. JUNCEA To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in seeds of  B. juncea, B. juncea  were transformed with the same construct used in flax transformation, i.e., Fad6 under the control of the  B .  napus  napin promoter. Fifteen independent transgenic plants were obtained. Fatty acid analysis of the transgenic seeds showed that there were three new fatty acids in the gas chromatogram of most transgenics compared with the wild type control (Figure 20). The three fatty acids were identified as 18:2(6,9) and 18:3(6,9,12), and 18:4(6,9,12,15).  B.juncea,  like flax, can also functionally express Fad6 from  P .  irregulare,  introducing a double bond at position 6 of endogenous substrate 18:1(9), 18:2(9,12), and 18:3(6,9,12) resulting in production of three corresponding Œî6 fatty acids in the transgenic seeds. Among the three new fatty acids produced in transgenic seeds, GLA is the most abundant one, with a level in transgenic seeds of 30% to 38% of the total fatty acids. The next most abundant component is SDA, which accounts for 3-10 % of the total fatty acids in several transgenic lines (Figure 21). The fatty acid compositions of transgenic seeds are shown in Figure 22. It is clear that the high level production of Œî6 desaturated fatty acids is at the cost of two major fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acids. Proportions of oleic and stearic acids in transgenics are slightly reduced, but not significantly compared to those in the wild type control. The content of linoleic acid in the transgenics was dramatically reduced. In the untransformed wild type, linoleic acid accounts for more than 40% of the total fatty acids in seeds. In transgenics, the level was reduced to less than 10%. \\nAs compared to the reduction of linoleic acid in transgenics, the decrease in linolenic acid in transgenics is less dramatic, but still significant. In the untransformed wild type, linolenic acid accounts for more than 10% of the total fatty acids in seeds while in transgenics the level was reduced to less than 5%. The two dramatically reduced fatty acids in transgenic seeds are the substrates of the Œî6 desaturase, and the reduction is the cost for producing two corresponding Œî6 desaturated fatty acids.

The entire contents of all references cited therein also are expressly incorporated by reference and are intended to be part of the present application. Background of the Invention Fatty acids are carboxylic acids with long-chain hydrocarbon side groups and play a fundamental role in many biological processes. Fatty acids are rarely free in nature but, rather, occur in esterified form as the major component of lipids. Lipids/fatty acids are sources of energy (e.g., b-oxidation) and are an integral part of cell membranes which are indispensable for processing biological or biochemical information. Fatty acids can be divided into two groups: the saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids which contain one or more carbon double bond in cis- configuration. Unsaturated fatty acids are produced by terminal desaturases that belong to the class of nonheme-iron enzymes. Each of these enzymes are part of a electron- transport system that contains two other proteins, namely cytocl rome b 5 and NADH- cytochrome b 5 reductase. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. Human and other mammals have a limited spectrum of these desaturases that are required for the formation of particular double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, humans have to take up some fatty acids through their diet. Such essential fatty acids, for example, are linoleic acid (C18:2); linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4). In contrast, insects and plants are able to synthesize a much larger variety of unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)) are essential components of cell membranes of various tissues -and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). For example, over 30% of fatty acids in brain phospholipid are 22:6 (n-3) and 20:4 (n-6). (Crawford, M.A., et al., (1997) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66:1032S-1041S). In retina, DHA accounts for more than 60% of the total fatty acids in the rod outer segment, the photosensitive part of the photoreceptor cell. (Giusto, N.M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has significant effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N.M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, some positive effects of DHA were also found on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L.A. and Yeo, Y.K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Therefore, the appropriate dietary supply of the fatty acid is important for humans to remain healthy. It is particularly important for infant, young children and senior citizens to adequately intake these fatty acids from the diet since they cannot be efficiently synthesized in their body and must be supplemented by food (Spector, A.A. (1999) Lipids 34:Sl-S3). DHA is a fatty acid of the n-3 series according to the location of the last double bond in the methyl end. It is synthesized via alternating steps of desaturation and elongation. Starting with 18:3 (9,12,15), biosynthesis of DHA involves Œî6 desaturation to 18:4 (6,9,12,15), followed by elongation to 20:4 (8,11,14,17) and Œî5 desaturation to 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17). Beyond this point, there are some controversies about the biosynthesis. The conventional view is that 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17) is elongated to 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19) and then converted to 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19) by the final Œî4 desaturation (Horrobin, D.F. (1992) Prog. Lipid Res. 31 :163-194). However, Sprecher et al. recently suggested an alternative pathway for DHA biosynthesis, which is independent of Œî4 desaturase, involving two consecutive elongations, a Œî6 desaturation and a two-carbon shortening via limited Œ≤-oxidation in peroxisome (Sprecher, H., et al. (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36:2471-2477; Sprecher, H., et al. (1999) Lipids 34:S153-S156). Production of DHA is important because of its beneficial effect on human health. Currently the major sources of DHA are oils from fish and algae. Fish oil is a major and traditional source for this fatty acid, however, it is usually oxidized by the time it is sold. In addition, the supply of the oil is highly variable and its source is in jeopardy with the shrinking fish populations while the algal source is expensive due to low yield and the high costs of extraction. EPA and AA are both Œî5 essential fatty acids. They form a unique class of food and feed constituents for humans and animals. EPA belongs to the n-3 series with five double bonds in the acyl chain, is found in marine food, and is abundant in oily fish from North Atlantic. AA belongs to the n-6 series with four double bonds. The lack of a double bond in the œâ-3 position confers on AA different properties than those found in EPA. The eicosanoids produced from AA have strong inflammatory and platelet aggregating properties, whereas those derived from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet aggregating properties. AA can be obtained from some foods such as meat, fish, and eggs, but the concentration is low. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is another essential fatty acid found in mammals. GLA is the metabolic intermediate for very long chain n-6 fatty acids and for various active molecules. In mammals, formation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is rate-limited by Œî6 desaturation. Many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, stress, diabetes, eczema, and some infections have been shown to depress the Œî6 desaturation step. In addition, GLA is readily catabolized from the oxidation and rapid cell division associated with certain disorders, e.g., cancer or inflammation. Therefore, dietary supplementation with GLA can reduce the risks of these disorders. Clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation with GLA is effective in treating some pathological conditions such as atopic eczema, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and iiiflarnmatory and cardiovascular disorders. The predominant sources of GLA are oils from plants such as evening primrose (Oenothera biennis), borage (Borago officinalis L.), black currant (Ribes nigrum), and from microorganisms such as Mortierella sp., Mucor sp., and Cyanobacteria. However, these GLA sources are not ideal for dietary supplementation due to large fluctuations in availability and costs associated with extraction processes. Summary of the Invention The biosynthesis of fatty acids is a major activity of plants and microorganisms. However, humans have a limited capacity for synthesizing essential fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Biotechnology has long been considered an efficient way to manipulate the process of producing fatty acids in plants and microorganisms. It is cost-effective and renewable with little side effects. Thus, tremendous industrial effort directed to the production of various compounds including speciality fatty acids and pharmaceutical polypeptides through the manipulation of plant, animal, and microorganismal cells has ensued. Accordingly, biotechnology is an attractive route for producing unsaturated fatty acids, especially LCPUFAs, in a safe, cost-efficient manner so as to garner the maximum therapeutic value from these fatty acids. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a family of nucleic acid molecules encoding novel desaturases. In particular, the present inventors have identified the Fad 4 (Œî4 desaturase), Fad5 and Fad5-2 (Œî5 desaturase), and Fad6 (Œî6 desaturase) which are involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6, n-3) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5, n-6); more specifically, Fad4 desaturases 22:5 (n-3) and 22:4 (n-6) resulting in DHA and DPA; Fad5 and Fad5-2 desaturases 20:4 (n-3) and 20:3(n-6) resulting in EPA and AA; and Fad6 desaturases 18:2 (n-6) and 18:3(n-3) resulting in GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) and SDA (stearidonic acid).

Detailed Description of the Invention The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of novel fatty acid desaturase family members, referred to interchangeably herein as \\\"desaturases\\\" or \\\"desaturase\\\" nucleic acid and protein molecules (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6). These novel molecules are members of the fatty acid desaturase family and are expressed in LCPUF As-producing organisms, e.g., Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare, Schizichytrium, and Crythecodinium. As used herein, the term \\\"fatty acids\\\" is art recognized and includes a long-chain hydrocarbon based carboxylic acid. Fatty acids are components of many lipids including glycerides. The most common naturally occurring fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids which have an even number of carbon atoms (16 or 18) and which may be saturated or unsaturated. \\\"Unsaturated\\\" fatty acids contain cis double bonds between the carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids encompassed by the present invention include, for example, DHA, GLA, and SDA. \\\"Polyunsaturated\\\" fatty acids contain more than one double bond and the double bonds are arranged in a methylene interrupted system (-CH=CH-CH 2 -CH=CH-). Fatty acids are described herein by a numbering system in which the number before the colon indicates the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, whereas the number after the colon is the number of double bonds that are present. In the case of unsaturated fatty acids, this is followed by a number in parentheses that indicates the position of the double bonds. Each number in parenthesis is the lower numbered carbon atom of the two connected by the double bond. For example, oleic acid can be described as 18:1(9) and linoleic acid can be described as 18:2(9, 12) indicating 18 carbons, one double bond at carbon 9, two double bonds at carbons 9 and 12, respectively. The controlling steps in the production of unsaturated fatty acids, i.e., the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, are catalyzed by membrane-associated fatty acid desaturases, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. As used herein, the term \\\"unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway\\\" refers to a series of chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of an unsaturated fatty acid either in vivo or in vitro. Such a pathway includes a series of desaturation and elongation steps which generate unsaturated fatty acids and ultimately, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Such unsaturated fatty acids can include, GLA 18:3 (6,9,12), SDA 18:4 (6,9,12,15), AA 20:4 (5,8,11,14), EPA 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17), and DPA 22:5 (4,7,10,13,16), and DHA 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19). Desaturases can contain a heme-binding motif and/or about three conservative histidine motifs, although additional domains may be present. Members of the fatty acid desaturase family convert saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), which are components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). Examples of LCPUFA include, among others, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N.M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, positive effects of DHA were also found in the treatment of diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L.A. and Yeo, Y.K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Thus, the desaturase molecules can be used to produce the LCPUFAs useful in treating disorders characterized by aberrantly regulated growth, proliferation, or differentiation. Such disorders include cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, or leukemia; tumor angiogenesis and metastasis; skeletal dysplasia; hepatic disorders; myelodysplastic syndromes; and hematopoietic and/or myeloproliferative disorders. Other disorders related to angiogenesis and which are, therefore, desaturase associated disorders include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and Klippel-Trenaunay- Weber syndrome. The term \\\"family\\\" when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention is intended to mean two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin or alternatively, can contain homologues of non- human origin, e.g., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. For example, the family of desaturase proteins of the present invention comprises one cytochrome b5 heme-binding motif. As used herein, the term \\\"heme- binding motif is an N-terminal extension of the cytochrome b5-like domain found in front-end desaturases. In another embodiment, members of the desaturase family of proteins include a \\\"histidine motifs\\\" in the protein, preferably, about three or four histidine motifs. As used herein, the term \\\"histidine motif includes a protein domain having at least about two histidine amino acid residues, preferably about tliree or four histidine amino acid residues, and is typically found in all microsomal desaturases as the third conservative histidine motif. Examples of cytochrome b5 heme-binding motifs and histidine motifs include amino acid residues 41-44, 182-186, 216-223, and 453-462 of SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 40-43, 171-175, 207-213, and 375-384 of SEQ ID NO:5, amino acid residues 40-45, 171-176, 208-213, and 395-400 of SEQ ID NO:8, and amino acid residues 42-47, 178-183, 215-220, and 400-405 of SEQ ID NO:l 1, as shown in Figures 3 and 6. Isolated desaturase proteins of the present invention have an amino acid sequence sufficiently homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 or are encoded by a nucleotide sequence sufficiently homologous to SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, 7, or 9. As used herein, the term \\\"sufficiently homologous\\\" refers to a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence which contains a sufficient or minimum number of identical or equivalent (e.g., an amino acid residue which has a similar side chain) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleotide sequences share common structural domains or motifs and/or a common functional activity. For example, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share common structural domains having at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity across the amino acid sequences of the domains and contain at least one and preferably two structural domains or motifs, are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. Furthermore, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity and share a common functional activity are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains or motifs: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif and has an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous or identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains: a heme- binding motif and/or a histidine motif, and is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7. In another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one heme-binding motif and/or at least about three histidine motifs, and has a desaturase activity. As used interchangeably herein, a \\\"desaturase activity,\\\" \\\"biological activity of a desaturase,\\\" or \\\"functional activity of a desaturase,\\\" includes an activity exerted or mediated by a desaturase protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on a desaturase responsive cell or on a desaturase substrate, as determined in vivo or in vitro, according to standard techniques. In one embodiment, a desaturase activity is a direct activity such as an association with a desaturase target molecule. As used herein, a \\\"target molecule\\\" or \\\"binding partner\\\" is a molecule e.g., a molecule involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, with which a desaturase protein binds or interacts in nature such that a desaturase-mediated function is achieved. A desaturase direct activity also includes the formation of a double bond between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule to form an unsaturated fatty acid molecule. The nucleotide sequence of the isolated Thraustochytrium sp. Œî4 desaturase, Fad4, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad4 cDNA are shown in Figure 1 and in SEQ ID NOs:l and 2, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad4 gene (the open reading frame), which is approximately 1560 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 59.1 kD and which is approximately 519 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Thraustochytrium sp. Œî5 desaturase, Fad5, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5 cDNA are shown in Figure 2 and in SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad5 gene, which is approximately 1320 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 49.8 kD and which is approximately 439 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî5 desaturase, Fad5- 2, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5-2 cDNA are shown in Figure 4 and in SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad5-2 gene, which is approximately 1371 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 456 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî6 desaturase, Fad6, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad6 cDNA are shown in Figure 5 and in SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad6 gene, which is approximately 1383 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 460 amino acid residues in length. Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections: I. Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode desaturase proteins or biologically active portions thereof, as well as nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify desaturase-encoding nucleic acid molecules (e.g., desaturase mRNA) and fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of desaturase nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term \\\"nucleic acid molecule\\\" is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. The term \\\"isolated nucleic acid molecule\\\" includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term \\\"isolated\\\" includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an \\\"isolated\\\" nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i. e. , sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated desaturase nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4kb, 3kb, 2kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an \\\"isolated\\\" nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, e.g. , a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, 7, or a portion thereof, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence in&rmation provided herein. Using all or a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7, as hybridization probes, desaturase nucleic acid molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook, J. et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd , ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989). Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule encompassing all or a portion of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7, can be isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed based upon the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A nucleic acid of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to desaturase nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule consists of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, or a portion of any of these nucleotide sequences. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7 is one which is sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO.l, 3, 5, or 7, such that it can hybridize to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby forming a stable duplex. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 (e.g., to the entire length of the nucleotide sequence), or a portion or complement of any of these nucleotide sequences. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least (or no greater than) 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-750, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000- 2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7. Moreover, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7, for example, a fragment which can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding a portion of a desaturase protein, e.g., a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein. The nucleotide sequence determined from the cloning of the desaturase gene allows for the generation of probes and primers designed for use in identifying and/or cloning other desaturase family members, as well as desaturase homologues from other species. The probe/primer (e.g., oligonucleotide) typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 12 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 75 consecutive nucleotides of a sense sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, of an anti-sense sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , 3, 5, or 7, or of a naturally occurring allelic variant or mutant of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Exemplary probes or primers are at least (or no greater than) 12 or 15, 20 or 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or more nucleotides in length and/or comprise consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein. Also included within the scope of the present invention are probes or primers comprising contiguous or consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein, but for the difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases within the probe or primer sequence. Probes based on the desaturase nucleotide sequences can be used to detect (e.g., specifically detect) transcripts or genomic sequences encoding the same or homologous proteins. In preferred embodiments, the probe further comprises a label group attached thereto, e.g., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. In another embodiment a set of primers is provided, e.g., primers suitable for use in a PCR, which can be used to amplify a selected region of a desaturase sequence, e.g., a domain, region, site or other sequence described herein. The primers should be at least 5, 10, or 50 base pairs in length and less than 100, or less than 200, base pairs in length. The primers should be identical, or differ by no greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases when compared to a sequence disclosed herein or to the sequence of a naturally occurring variant. Such probes can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissue which misexpress a desaturase protein, such as by measuring a level of a desaturase-encoding nucleic acid in a sample of cells from a subject, e.g., detecting desaturase mRNA levels or determining whether a genomic desaturase gene has been mutated or deleted. A nucleic acid fragment encoding a \\\"biologically active portion of a desaturase protein\\\" can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, which encodes a polypeptide having a desaturase biological activity (the biological activities of the desaturase proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the desaturase protein (e.g. , by recombinant expression in vitro) and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the desaturase protein. In an exemplary embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is at least 50-100, 100- 250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and encodes a protein having a desaturase activity (as described herein). The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same desaturase proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs by at least 1, but no greater than 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 amino acid residues from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 . In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the amino acid sequence of human desaturase. If an alignment is needed for this comparison, the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. Nucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologues (different locus), and orthologues (different organism) or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product). Allelic variants result, for example, from DNA sequence polymorphisms within a population (e.g., the human population) that lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the desaturase proteins. Such genetic polymorphism in the desaturase genes may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. As used herein, the terms \\\"gene\\\" and \\\"recombinant gene\\\" refer to nucleic acid molecules which include an open reading frame encoding a desaturase protein, e.g., oilseed desaturase protein, and can further include non-coding regulatory sequences, and introns. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a naturally occurring allelic variant of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, wherein the nucleic acid molecule hybridizes to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions. Allelic variants of desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, include both functional and non-functional desaturase proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein that maintain the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., a fatty acid, e.g., DHA); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. The fatty acids produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention are also useful in treating disorders such as aging, stress, diabetes, cancer, inflammatory disorders (e.g., arthritis, eczema), and cardiovascular disorders. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only a conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Non-functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, that do not have the ability to, e.g. , (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, such as 18:4 (6,9,12,15)); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. The present invention further provides orthologues (e.g., human orthologues of the desaturase proteins). Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins are proteins that are isolated from other organisms and possess the same desaturase substrate or target molecule binding mechanisms, double bond forming mechanisms, modulating mechanisms of growth and development of the brain in infants, maintenance mechanisms of normal brain function in adults, ability to affect photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, ability to affect rhodopsin activation, development mechanisms of rods and/or cones, and/or modulating mechanisms of cellular growth and/or proliferation of the non- human desaturase proteins. Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins can readily be identified as comprising an amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other desaturase family members and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, another desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins from different species, and which, thus, have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, Schizochytrium or Crythecodinium desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the desaturase cDNAs of the invention can be isolated based on their homology to the desaturase nucleic acids disclosed herein using the cDNAs disclosed herein, or a portion thereof, as a hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent hybridization conditions. Orthologues, homologues and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art (e.g., by hybridization to an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions). In one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention is at least 15, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7. In other embodiment, the nucleic acid is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length. As used herein, the term \\\"hybridizes under stringent conditions\\\" is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences that are significantly identical or homologous to each other remain hybridized to each other. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% identical to each other remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1995), sections 2, 4, and 6. Additional stringent conditions can be found in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Sambrook et al, Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), chapters 7, 9, and 11. A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4X sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70¬∞C (or alternatively hybridization in 4X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞C) followed by one or more washes in IX SSC, at about 65-70¬∞C. A preferred, non-limiting example of highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in IX SSC, at about 65-70¬∞C (or alternatively hybridization in IX SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞C) followed by one or more washes in 0.3X SSC, at about 65-70¬∞C. A preferred, non-limiting example of reduced stringency hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4X SSC, at about 50-60¬∞C (or alternatively hybridization in 6X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 40-45¬∞C) followed by one or more washes in 2X SSC, at about 50-60¬∞C. Ranges intermediate to the above- recited values, e.g., at 65-70¬∞C or at 42-50¬∞C are also intended to be encompassed by the present invention. SSPE (lxSSPE is 0.15M NaCI, 1 OmM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 1.25mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (IX SSC is 0.15M NaCI and 15mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-10¬∞C less than the melting temperature (T m ) of the hybrid, where T m is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞C) = 2(# of A + T bases) + 4(# of G + C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞C) = 81.5 + 16.6(log 10 [Na + ]) + 0.41 (%G+C) - (600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na + ] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer ([Na + ] for IX SSC = 0.165 M). It will also be recognized by the skilled practitioner that additional reagents may be added to hybridization and/or wash buffers to decrease non-specific hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to membranes, for example, nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, including but not limited to blocking agents (e.g. , BSA or salmon or herring sperm carrier DNA), detergents (e.g., SDS), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA), Ficoll, PVP and the like. When using nylon membranes, in particular, an additional preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 0.25-0.5M NaH 2 PO 4 , 7% SDS at about 65¬∞C, followed by one or more washes at 0.02M NaH 2 PO 4 , 1% SDS at 65¬∞C (see e.g., Church and Gilbert (1984) Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1991-1995), or alternatively 0.2X SSC, 1% SDS. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7 corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a \\\"naturally-occurring\\\" nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature (e.g., encodes a natural protein). In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of the desaturase sequences that may exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by mutation into the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded desaturase proteins, without altering the functional ability of the desaturase proteins. For example, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at \\\"non- essential\\\" amino acid residues can be made in the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A \\\"non-essential\\\" amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 (e.g., the sequence of SEQ ID O:2, 5, 8, or 11) without altering the biological activity, whereas an \\\"essential\\\" amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the desaturase proteins of the present invention, e.g., those present in a heme- binding motif or a histidine motif, are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. Furthermore, additional amino acid residues that are conserved between the desaturase proteins of the present invention and other members of the fatty acid desaturase family are not likely to be amenable to alteration. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such desaturase proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, yet retain biological activity. In one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, wherein the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% 99% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, e.g. , to the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a desaturase protein homologous to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 , 3, 5, or 7, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7 by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A \\\"conservative amino acid substitution\\\" is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a desaturase protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a desaturase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for desaturase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. In a preferred embodiment, a mutant desaturase protein can be assayed for the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. II. Isolated Desaturase Proteins One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated or recombinant desaturase proteins and polypeptides, and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment, native desaturase proteins can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, desaturase proteins are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a desaturase protein or polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. An \\\"isolated\\\" or \\\"purified\\\" protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the desaturase protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language \\\"substantially free of cellular material\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language \\\"substantially free of cellular material\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, or 30% (by dry weight) of non-desaturase protein (also referred to herein as a \\\"contaminating protein\\\"), more preferably less than about 20% of non-desaturase protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non- desaturase protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-desaturase protein. When the desaturase protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. The language \\\"substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language \\\"substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals. It should be understood that the proteins or this invention can also be in a form which is different than their corresponding naturally occurring proteins and/or which is still in association with at least some cellular components. For example, the protein can be associated with a cellular membrane. As used herein, a \\\"biologically active portion\\\" of a desaturase protein includes a fragment of a desaturase protein which participates in an interaction between a desaturase molecule and a non-desaturase molecule (e.g., a desaturase substrate such as fatty acid). Biologically active portions of a desaturase protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the desaturase amino acid sequences, e.g., the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ IDNO:2, 5, 8, or 11 which include sufficient amino acid residues to exhibit at least one activity of a desaturase protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the desaturase protein; the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. A biologically active portion of a desaturase protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 11 . 00, 1150, 1200 or more amino acids in length. In one embodiment, a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein comprises a heme-binding motif and/or at least one histidine motifs, preferably about three histidine motifs. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native desaturase protein. In a pref^Œû - . bodimeni, a desaturase protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In other embodiments, the desaturase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, yet differs in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. In another embodiment, the desaturase protein is a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In another embodiment, the invention features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. This invention further features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the length of the reference sequence (e.g., when aligning a second sequence to the Fad4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 having 519 amino acid residues, at least 156, preferably at least 208, more preferably at least 260, even more preferably at least 311, and even more preferably at least 363, 415, or 467 aminœå acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 having 439 amino acid residues, at least 132, preferably at least 176, more preferably at least 220, even more preferably at least 263, and even more preferably at least 307, 351, or 395 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5-2 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 having 456 amino acid residues, at least 137, preferably at least 182, more preferably at least 228, even more preferably at least 273, and even more preferably at least 319, 365, or 419 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad6 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8 having 460 amino acid residues, at least 138, preferably at least 184, more preferably at least 230, even more preferably at least 276, and even more preferably at least 322, 368, or 414 amino acid residues are aligned). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid \\\"identity\\\" is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid \\\"homology\\\"). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch (J Mol. Biol. (48):444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A preferred, non-limiting example of parameters to be used in conjunction with the GAP program include a Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller (Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:11-17 (1988)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0 or version 2.0U), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a \\\"query sequence\\\" to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score = 100, wordlength = 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to desaturase nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score = 50, wordlength = 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to desaturase protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. III. Methods of Producing Unsaturated Fatty Acids The present invention provides new and improved methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., LCPUFAs, such as, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 (n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 (n-6)), AA (Arachidonic acid, 20:4 (n-6)) and EPA (eicosapentaenioc acid, 20:5(n-3)). A. Recombinant Cells and Methods for Culturing Cells The present invention further features recombinant vectors that include nucleic acid sequences that encode the gene products as described herein, preferably Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 gene products. The term recombinant vector includes a vector (e.g., plasmid) that has been altered, modified or engineered such that it contains greater, fewer or different nucleic acid sequences than those included in the native vector or plasmid. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector includes the nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one fatty acid desaturase enzyme operably linked to regulatory sequences. The phrase \\\"operably linked to regulatory sequence(s)\\\" means that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression (e.g., enhanced, increased, constitutive, basal, attenuated, decreased or repressed expression) of the nucleotide sequence, preferably expression of a gene product encoded by the nucleotide sequence (e.g. , when the recombinant vector is introduced into a cell). Exemplary vectors are described in further detail herein as well as in, for example, Frascotti et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,137, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The term \\\"regulatory sequence\\\" includes nucleic acid sequences which affect (e.g. , modulate or regulate) expression of other (non-regulatory) nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence is included in a recombinant vector in a similar or identical position and/or orientation relative to a particular gene of interest as is observed for the regulatory sequence and gene of interest as it appears in nature, e.g., in a native position and/or orientation. For example, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to the gene in the natural organism (e.g., operably linked to \\\"native\\\" Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequence (e.g., to the \\\"native\\\" Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 promoter). Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g. , a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to another (e.g., a different) gene in the natural organism. For example, a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene can be included in a vector operably linked to non-Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequences. Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence from another organism. For example, regulatory sequences from other microbes (e.g., other bacterial regulatory sequences, bacteriophage regulatory sequences and the like) can be operably linked to a particular gene of interest. Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers, termination signals and other expression control elements (e.g., binding sites for transcriptional and/or translational regulatory proteins, for example, in the transcribed mRNA). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989. Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., constitutive promoters and strong constitutive promoters), those which direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., inducible promoters, for example, xylose inducible promoters) and those which attenuate or repress expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., attenuation signals or repressor sequences). It is also within the scope of the present invention to regulate expression of a gene of interest by removing or deleting regulatory sequences. For example, sequences involved in the negative regulation of transcription can be removed such that expression of a gene of interest is enhanced. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes nucleic acid sequences that encode at least one gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) operably linked to a promoter or promoter sequence. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes a terminator sequence or terminator sequences (e.g., transcription terminator sequences). The term \\\"terminator sequences\\\" includes regulatory sequences which serve to terminate transcription of mRNA. Terminator sequences (or tandem transcription terminators) can further serve to stabilize mRNA (e.g., by adding structure to mRNA), for example, against nucleases. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes antibiotic resistance sequences. The term \\\"antibiotic resistance sequences\\\" includes sequences which promote or confer resistance to antibiotics on the host organism. In one embodiment, the antibiotic resistance sequences are selected from the group consisting of cat (chloramphenicol resistance), tet (teœÑracycline resistance) sequences, erm (erythromycin resistance) sequences, neo (neomycin resistance) sequences and spec (spectinomycin resistance) sequences. Recombmant vectors of the present invention can further include homologous recombination sequences (e.g., sequences designed to allow recombination of the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host organism). For example, amyE sequences can be used as homology targets for recombination into the host chromosome. The term \\\"manipulated cell\\\" includes a cell that has been engineered (e.g., genetically engineered) or modified such that the cell has at least one fatty acid desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6, such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced. Modification or engineering of such microorganisms can be according to any methodology described herein including, but not limited to, deregulation of a biosynthetic pathway and/or overexpression of at least one biosynthetic enzyme. A \\\"manipulated\\\" enzyme (e.g., a \\\"manipulated\\\" biosynthetic enzyme) includes an enzyme, the expression or production of which has been altered or modified such that at least one upstream or downstream precursor, substrate or product of the enzyme is altered or modified, for example, as compared to a corresponding wild-type or naturally occurring enzyme. The term \\\"overexpressed\\\" or \\\"overexpression\\\" includes expression of a gene product (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase) at a level greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. In one embodiment, the cell can be genetically manipulated (e.g., genetically engineered) to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. Genetic manipulation can include, but is not limited to, altering or modifying regulatory sequences or sites associated with expression of a particular gene (e.g. , by adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or by removing regulatory sequences such that expression is constitutive), modifying the chromosomal location of a particular gene, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to a particular gene such as a ribosome binding site or transcription terminator, increasing the copy number of a particular gene, modifying proteins (e.g. , regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of a particular gene routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). In another embodiment, the cell can be physically or environmentally manipulated to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. For example, a cell can be treated with or cultured in the presence of an agent known or suspected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. Alternatively, a cell can be cultured at a temperature selected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. The term \\\"deregulated\\\" or \\\"deregulation\\\" includes the alteration or modification of at least one gene in a cell that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway, such that the level or activity of the biosynthetic enzyme in the cell is altered or modified. Preferably, at least one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the gene product is enhanced or increased. The phrase \\\"deregulated pathway\\\" can also include a biosynthetic pathway in which more than one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the level or activity of more than one biosynthetic enzyme is altered or modified. The ability to \\\"deregulate\\\" a pathway (e.g., to simultaneously deregulate more than one gene in a given biosynthetic pathway) in a cell arises from the particular phenomenon of cells in which more than one enzyme (e.g., two or three biosynthetic enzymes) are encoded by genes occurring adjacent to one another on a contiguous piece of genetic material termed an \\\"operon\\\". The term \\\"operon\\\" includes a coordinated unit of gene expression that contains a promoter and possibly a regulatory element associated with one or more, preferably at least two, structural genes (e.g., genes encoding enzymes, for example, biosynthetic enzymes). Expression of the structural genes can be coordinately regulated, for example, by regulatory proteins binding to the regulatory element or by anti- termination of transcription. The structural genes can be transcribed to give a single mRNA that encodes all of the structural proteins. Due to the coordinated regulation of genes included in an operon, alteration or modification of the single promoter and/or regulatory element can result in alteration or modification of each gene product encoded by the operon. Alteration or modification of the regulatory element can include, but is not limited to removing the endogenous promoter and/or regulatory element(s), adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or removing regulatory sequences such that expression of the gene products is modified, modifying the chromosomal location of the operon, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the operon or within the operon such as a ribosome binding site, increasing the copy number of the operon, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of the operon and/or translation of the gene products of the operon, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of genes routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). Deregulation can also involve altering the coding region of one or more genes to yield, for example, an enzyme that is feedback resistant or has a higher or lower specific activity. A particularly preferred \\\"recombinant\\\" cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a plant-derived gene or gene product or an microorganismally-derived gene or gene product. The term \\\"plant-derived,\\\" \\\"microorganismally-derived,\\\" or \\\"derived-from,\\\" for example, includes a gene which is naturally found in a microorganism or a plant, e.g., an oilseed plant, or a gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) or which is encoded by a plant gene or a gene from a microorganism (e.g., encoded SEQ ID NO:l, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ IDNO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7). The methodologies of the present invention feature recombinant cells which overexpress at least one fatty acid desaturase. In one embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a ThrŒ±uschytrium sp. fatty acid desaturase (e.g., has been engineered to overexpress at least one of ThrŒ±uschytrium sp. Œî4 or Œî5 desaturase (the Fad4 or Fad5 gene product) (e.g. , a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or 4 or encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3). In another embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Pythium irregulare Œî5 or Œî6 desaturase (the Fad5-2 or Fad6 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or 8 or encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 or 5). In another embodiment, the invention features a cell (e.g., a microbial cell) that has been transformed with a vector comprising a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:l, 3, 5, or 7). Another aspect of the present invention features a method of modulating the production of fatty acids comprising culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., a desaturase) such that modulation of fatty acid production occurs (e.g., production of unsaturated fatty acids is enhanced). The method of culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g.,Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6) to modulate the production of fatty acids is referred to herein as \\\"biotransformation.\\\" The biotransformation processes can utilize recombinant cells and/or desaturases described herein. The term \\\"biotransformation process,\\\" also referred to herein as \\\"bioconversion processes,\\\" includes biological processes which result in the production (e.g., transformation or conversion) of any compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is upstream of a fatty acid desaturase to a compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is downstream of a fatty acid desaturase, in particular, an unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of an unsaturated fatty acid comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses at least one fatty acid desaturase with at least one appropriate substrate under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced and, optionally, recovering the fatty acid. In a preferred embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of unsaturated fatty acids comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 with an appropriate substrate (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid) under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA, SDA, or GLA) is produced and, optionally, recovering the unsaturated fatty acid. Conditions under which an unsaturated fatty acid is produced can include any conditions which result in the desired production of an unsaturated fatty acid. The cell(s) and/or enzymes used in the biotransformation reactions are in a form allowing them to perform their intended function (e.g., producing a desired fatty acids). The cells can be whole cells, or can be only those portions of the cells necessary to obtain the desired end result. The cells can be suspended (e.g., in an appropriate solution such as buffered solutions or media), rinsed (e.g., rinsed free of media from culturing the cell), acetone-dried, immobilized (e.g., with poly aery lamide gel or k- carrageenan or on synthetic supports, for example, beads, matrices and the like), fixed, cross-linked or permeablized (e.g., have permeablized membranes and/or walls such that compounds, for example, substrates, intermediates or products can more easily pass through said membrane or wall). The type of cell can be any cell capable of being used within the methods of the invention, e.g., plant, animal, or microbial cells. An important aspect of the present invention involves growing the recombinant plant or culturing the recombinant microorganisms described herein, such that a desired compound (e.g., a desired unsaturated fatty acid) is produced. The term \\\"culturing\\\" includes maintaining and/or growing a living microorganism of the present invention (e.g., maintaining and/or growing a culture or strain). In one embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in liquid media. In another embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in solid media or semi-solid media. In a preferred embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in media (e.g., a sterile, liquid media) comprising nutrients essential or beneficial to the maintenance and/or growth of the microorganism (e.g., carbon sources or carbon substrate, for example complex carbohydrates such as bean or grain meal, starches, sugars, sugar alcohols, hydrocarbons, oils, fats, fatty acids, organic acids and alcohols; nitrogen sources, for example, vegetable proteins, peptones, peptides and amino acids derived from grains, beans and tubers, proteins, peptides and amino acids derived form animal sources such as meat, milk and animal byproducts such as peptones, meat extracts and casein hydrolysates; inorganic nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate; phosphorus sources, for example, phosphoric acid, sodium and potassium salts thereof; trace elements, for example, magnesium, iron, manganese, calcium, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum, and/or cobalt salts; as well as growth factors such as amino acids, vitamins, growth promoters and the like). Preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled pH. The term \\\"controlled pH\\\" includes any pH which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of about 7. In another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.5. The desired pH may be maintained by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art. Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled aeration. The term \\\"controlled aeration\\\" includes sufficient aeration (e.g., oxygen) to result in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, aeration is controlled by regulating oxygen levels in the culture, for example, by regulating the amount of oxygen dissolved in culture media. Preferably, aeration of the culture is controlled by agitating the culture. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the growth vessel (e.g., fermentor) or by various pumping equipment. Aeration may be further controlled by the passage of sterile air or oxygen through the medium (e.g., through the fermentation mixture). Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured without excess foaming (e.g., via addition of antifoaming agents). Moreover, plants or microorganisms of the present invention can be cultured under controlled temperatures. The term \\\"controlled temperature\\\" includes any temperature which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞C and 95¬∞C. In another embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞C and 70¬∞C. Preferred temperatures are between 20¬∞C and 55¬∞C, more preferably between 30¬∞C and 45¬∞C or between 30¬∞C and 50¬∞C. Microorganisms can be cultured (e.g., maintained and/or grown) in liquid media and preferably are cultured, either continuously or intermittently, by conventional culturing methods such as standing culture, test tube culture, shaking culture (e.g., rotary shaking culture, shake flask culture, etc.), aeration spinner culture, or fermentation. In a preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in shake flasks. In a more preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in a fermentor (e.g., a fermentation process). Fermentation processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, batch, fed-batch and continuous methods of fermentation. The phrase \\\"batch process\\\" or \\\"batch fermentation\\\" refers to a closed system in which the composition of media, nutrients, supplemental additives and the like is set at the beginning of the fermentation and not subject to alteration during the fermentation, however, attempts may be made to control such factors as pH and oxygen concentration to prevent excess media acidification and/or microorganism death. The phrase \\\"fed- batch process\\\" or \\\"fed-batch\\\" fermentation refers to a batch fermentation with the exception that one or more substrates or supplements are added (e.g., added in increments or continuously) as the fermentation progresses. The phrase \\\"continuous process\\\" or \\\"continuous fermentation\\\" refers to a system in which a defined fermentation media is added continuously to a fermentor and an equal amount of used or \\\"conditioned\\\" media is simultaneously removed, preferably for recovery of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). A variety of such processes have been developed and are well-known in the art. The phrase \\\"culturing under conditions such that a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid, for example, DHA) is produced\\\" includes maintaining and/or growing plants or microorganisms under conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, duration, etc.) appropriate or sufficient to obtain production of the desired compound or to obtain desired yields of the particular compound being produced. For example, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to produce the desired amount of a unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA). Preferably, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to substantially reach maximal production of the unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, culturing is continued for about 12 to 24 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for about 24 to 36 hours, 36 to 48 hours, 48 to 72 hours, 72 to 96 hours, 96 to 120 hours, 120 to 144 hours, or greater than 144 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to reach production yields of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, cells are cultured such that at least about 15 to 20 g/L of unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 20 to 25 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 25 to 30 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 30 to 35 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 35 to 40 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced (e.g., at least about 37 g/L unsaturated fatty acids ) or at least about 40 to 50 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced. In yet another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured under conditions such that a preferred yield of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, a yield within a range set forth above, is produced in about 24 hours, in about 36 hours, in about 48 hours, in about 72 hours, or in about 96 hours. In producing unsaturated fatty acids, it may further be desirable to culture cells of the present invention in the presence of supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates. The term \\\"supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrate\\\" includes an agent or compound which, when brought into contact with a cell or included in the culture medium of a cell, serves to enhance or increase unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added in the form of a concentrated solution or suspension (e.g., in a suitable solvent such as water or buffer) or in the form of a solid (e.g., in the form of a powder). Moreover, supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added as a single aliquot, continuously or intermittently over a given period of time. The methodology of the present invention can further include a step of recovering a desired compound (e.g. , an unsaturated fatty acid). The term \\\"recovering\\\" a desired compound includes extracting, harvesting, isolating or purifying the compound from culture media. Recovering the compound can be performed according to any conventional isolation or purification methodology known in the art including, but not limited to, treatment with a conventional resin (e.g., anion or cation exchange resin, non- ionic adsorption resin, etc.), treatment with a conventional adsorbent (e.g., activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina, etc.), alteration of pH, solvent extraction (e.g., with a conventional solvent such as an alcohol, ethyl acetate, hexane and the like), dialysis, filtration, concentration, crystallization, recrystallization, pH adjustment, lyophilization and the like. For example, a compound can be recovered from culture media by first removing the microorganisms from the culture. Media is then passed through or over a cation exchange resin to remove unwanted cations and then through or over an anion exchange resin to remove unwanted inorganic anions and organic acids having stronger acidities than the unsaturated fatty acid of interest (e.g., DHA). Preferably, a desired compound of the present invention is \\\"extracted,\\\" \\\"isolated\\\" or \\\"purified\\\" such that the resulting preparation is substantially free of other components (e.g., free of media components and/or fermentation byproducts). The language \\\"substantially free of other components\\\" includes preparations of desired compound in which the compound is separated (e.g. , purified or partially purified) from media components or fermentation byproducts of the culture from which it is produced. In one embodiment, the preparation has greater than about 80% (by dry weight) of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 20% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), more preferably greater than about 90% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 10% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), still more preferably greater than about 95% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 5% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), and most preferably greater than about 98-99% desired compound (e.g., less than about 1-2% other media components or fermentation byproducts). When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to a salt, the compound is preferably further free (e.g. , substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the salt. When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to an alcohol, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the alcohol. In an alternative embodiment, the desired unsaturated fatty acid is not purified from the plant or microorganism, for example, when the plant or microorganism is biologically non-hazardous (e.g., safe). For example, the entire plant or culture (or culture supernatant) can be used as a source of product (e.g., crude product). In one embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) supernatant is used without modification. In another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is concentrated. In yet another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is pulverized, dried, or lyophilized. B. High Yield Production Methodologies A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention is a high yield production method for producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., DHA, comprising culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that the unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a significantly high yield. The phrase \\\"high yield production method,\\\" for example, a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) includes a method that results in production of the desired compound at a level which is elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods. Preferably, a high yield production method results in production of the desired compound at a significantly high yield. The phrase \\\"significantly high yield\\\" includes a level of production or yield which is sufficiently elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods, for example, which is elevated to a level sufficient for commercial production of the desired product (e.g., production of the product at a commercially feasible cost). In one embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 2 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 10 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 20 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 40 g/L. The invention further features a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) that involves culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that a sufficiently elevated level of compound is produced within a commercially desirable period of time. In an exemplary embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 15-20 g/L in 36 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 25-30 g/L in 48 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 35-40 g/L in 72 hours, for example, greater that 37 g/L in 72 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30-40 g/L in 60 hours, for example, greater that 30, 35 or 40 g/L in 60 hours. Values and ranges included and/or intermediate within the ranges set forth herein are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention. For example, unsaturated fatty acid production at levels of at least 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 g/L in 60 hours are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. In another example, ranges of 30-35 g/L or 35-40 g/L are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. Moreover, the skilled artisan will appreciate that culturing a manipulated microorganism to achieve a production level of, for example, \\\"30-40 g/L in 60 hours\\\" includes culturing the microorganism for additional time periods (e.g. , time periods longer than 60 hours), optionally resulting in even higher yields of an unsaturated fatty acid being produced. IV. Compositions The desaturase nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and fragments thereof, of the invention can be used to produce unsaturated fatty acids which can be incorporated into compositions. Compositions of the present invention include, e.g., compositions for use as animal feed, compositions for use as neutraceuticals (e.g., dietary supplements), and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise an unsaturated fatty acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language \\\"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\\\" is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL‚Ñ¢ (BASF, Parsippany, NJ) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a LCPUFA, or a fragment thereof, produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811. It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with a LCPUFA in the range of between about 0.1 to 20 mg kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody, protein, or polypeptide used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent from the results of diagnostic assays as described herein. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the figures, are incorporated herein by reference. EXAMPLES Materials: Thraustochytrium s.p ATCC 21685 and Pythium irregulare were purchased from American type culture collection (12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland, 20852 USA) and grown in a medium (Weete, J.D., et al. (1997) Lipids 32:839-845) at 24¬∞C for 7days. After then biomass were harvested by centrifugation and used for RNA isolation. EXAMPLE 1: CONSTRUCTION AND SCREENING OF cDNA LIBRARY Total RNA was isolated from the above materials according to Qiu and Erickson (Qiu, X. and Eriekson, L. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. Repr. 12:209-214). The cDNA library was constructed from the total RNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase from Gibco-BRL. The second strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I from Stratagene. After size fractionation, cDNA inserts larger than 1 kb were ligated into Œª Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene). The recombinant ~ DNAs were then packed with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) and plated on NZY plates. The resulting library represented more than 5 x 106 independent clones. Screening of the cDNA library was performed according to standard methods (Sambrook, J, Fritseh, E.F., Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular cloning - A laboratory manual. (Cold Spring Harbor, New York, USA.) EXAMPLE 2: RT-PCR The single strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) from total RNA and was then used as the template for PCR reaction with two degenerate primers (The forward primer: GCXCA/GAXGAXCAC/TCCXGGXGG and the reverse primer: ATXTG/TXGGA/GAAXAG/AG/ATGG/ATG). The PCR amplification consisted of 35 cycles with 1 min at 94¬∞ C, 1.5 min at 55 ¬∞C and 2 min at 72 ¬∞C followed by an extension step at 72 ¬∞C for 10 min. The amplified products from 800 bp to 1000 bp were isolated from agarose gel and purified by a kit (Qiaex II gel purification, Qiagen), and subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR ¬Æ 2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were then sequenced by PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). EXAMPLE 3: EXPRESSION OF FAD4, FAD5, FAD5-2, AND FAD6 IN YEAST The open reading frames of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 were amplified by PCR using the Precision Plus enzyme (Stratagene) and cloned into a TA cloning vector (pCR ¬Æ 2.1 , Invitrogen). Having confirmed that the PCR products were identical to the original cDNAs by sequencing, the fragments were then released by a BarnHI-EcoRI double digestion and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the inducible promoter GALL Yeast strains InvSc2 (Invitrogen) was transformed with the expression constructs using the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil (Gietz, D., et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20:1425; Covello, P.S. and Reed, D.W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111 :223-226). Transformants were first grown in minimal medium lacking uracil and containing glucose at 28¬∞C. After overnight culture, the cells were spun down, washed and resuspended in distilled water. Minimal medium containing 2% galactose, with or without 0.3 mM substrate fatty acids in the presence of 0.1 % tergitol, was inoculated with the yeast transformant cell suspension and incubated at 20¬∞C for three days, and then 15 ¬∞C for another three days. EXAMPLE 4: FATTY ACID ANALYSIS Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare and yeast cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water. Then 2 mL methanolic KOH (7.5% w/v KOH in 95% methanol) was added to the materials and the mixture sealed in a 12 ml glass culture tube was heated to 80¬∞C for 2 hours. 0.5 mL water was added and the sample was extracted twice with 2 mL hexane to remove the non-saponifiable lipids. The remaining aqueous phase was then acidified by adding 1 mL 6 N HCI and extracted twice with 2 mL hexane. The hexane phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. 2 mL 3 N methanolic HCI (SUPELCO, Supelco Park, Bellefonte, PA 16823-0048) was added and the mixture was heated at 80¬∞C for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL 0.9% NaCI was added and the mixture extracted twice with 2 x 2 mL hexane. The combined hexane was evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS according to Covello & Reed (Covello, P.S. and Reed, D.W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111 :223-226). GC/MS analysis was performed in standard El mode using a Fisons VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, UK) controlled by Masslynx version 2.0 software, coupled to a GC 8000 Series gas chromatograph. A DB-23 column (30M x 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 Ilm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) that was temperature-programmed at 180 ¬∞C for 1 min, then 4 C /rnin to 240 ¬∞C and held for 15 minutes, was used for FAME analysis. EXAMPLE 5: TRANSFORMATION OF BRASSICA JUNCEA AND FLAX (LINUM USITATISSIMUM) AND EXOGENOUS FATTY ACID TREATMENT The hypocotyls of 5-6 day seedlings of B. juncea and flax were used as explants for inoculation with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens that hosts binary vectors with the full-length cDNAs under the control of the different promoters. The 20-day transgenic seedlings were used for exogenous fatty acid treatment. The seedling was divided into three parts: leaves, stems and roots. Each was cut into the small pieces and placed in a 24-well titer plate. To each well, 2 mL 0.05% sodium salt of substrates (NuCheck Prep Inc., Elysian, MN) was added. The plate was then incubated at 24¬∞C for 4 h with gentle shaking. After incubation, the plant tissues were washed three times with water and then used for fatty acid analysis. EXAMPLE 6: FATTY ACID PROFILE OF THE THRA USCHYTRIUM SP. Thraustochytrium and Pythium irregulare have recently drawn scientific attention due to its ability in production of LCPUFAs such as DHA, AA, EPA and DPA. Figures 15 and 16 show the fatty acid composition of the lipids isolated from 7 day cultures of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare, respectively. As shown in the tables, the microorganisms contain a broad range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from both n-3 and n-6 families, from 1 8-carbon A6 fatty acids (gamma-linolenic acid and steardonic acid) to 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids (DHA and DPA). The organisms, especially Thraustochytrium sp., appear to contain a full-set of desaturation and elongation enzymes required for the DHA and DPA biosynthesis. The strain lacks 24-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, the proposed precursors for DHA and DPA synthesis in Precher' s pathway (Voss, A., et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:19995-20000; Mohammed, B.S., et al. (1997) Biochem. J. 326:425-430). The 24-carbon fatty acid may not be involved in in vivo synthesis of 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids such as DHA and DPA in Thraustochytrium sp. EXAMPLE 7: IDENTIFICATION OF cDNAs CODING FOR THE \\\"FRONT-END\\\" DESATURASE To identify genes coding for desaturases involved in biosynthesis of LCFUFAs in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare, a PCR-based cloning strategy was adopted. Two degenerate primers are designed to target the heme-binding motif of N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in front-end desaturases and the third conservative histidine motif in all microsomal desaturases, respectively. The rational behind the design is that the desaturases involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare, should have similar primary structure as other front-end desaturases, i.e. N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in the desaturase. Four cDNAs fragments were identified from Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare that encode fusion proteins containing cyt b5-like domain in the N-terminus. To isolate full-length cDNA clones, the four inserts were used as probes to screen cDNA libraries of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare, which resulted in identification of several cDNA clones in each group. Sequencing of all those clones identified four full-length cDNAs which were named as Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2 and Fad6. The open reading frame of Fad4 is 1560 bp and codes for 519 amino acids with molecular weight of 59.1 kDa (Figure 1). Fad5 is 1230 bp in length and codes for 439 amino acids with molecular weight of 49.8 kDa (Figure 2). A sequence comparison of these two sequences from Thraustochytrium sp. showed only 16% amino acid identity between the deduced proteins. A detailed analysis revealed that Fad4 is 80 amino acids longer than Fad5, occurring between the second and third conservative histidine motifs (Figure 3). The open reading frame of Fad5-2 from Pythium irregulare is 1371 bp and codes for 456 amino acids (Figure 4). Fad6 from Pythium irregulare is 1383 bp in length and codes for 460 amino acids (Figure 5). Sequence comparison of the two sequences from Pythium irregulare showed over 39% similarity between the deduced proteins (Figure 6). A BLASTP‚Ñ¢ search of the protein database revealed the following hits for each of the four proteins, Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6: Fad 4 (519 amino acid residues) Blastp nr Fad 5 (439 amino acid residues) Blastp nr Fad 5-2 (456 amino acid residues) Blastp nr Fad 6 (459 amino acid residues) Blastp nr EXAMPLE 8: EXPRESSION OF FAD4, FAD5, FAD5-2, AND FAD6 IN YEAST To confirm the function of Fad4, the full-length cDNA was expressed in the yeast strain InvSc2 under the control of the inducible promoter. Figure 7 shows that with supplementation of the medium with 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19), yeast cells containing Fad4 cDNA had an extra fatty acid as compared to the vector control. The peak has a retention time identical to the DHA standard. LC/MS analysis of the free fatty acid showed that it yields deprotonated molecular ions (m z = 279) identical to the DHA standard in negative ion electrospray. Moreover, GC/MS analysis of the FAME confirmed that the spectrum of the peak is identical to that of the DHA standard (Figure 8). These results indicate that Fad4 is a Œî4 fatty acid desaturase which is able to introduce a double bond at position 4 of the 22:5(7,10,13,16,19) substrate, resulting in a Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DHA (22:6-4,7,10,13,16,19). To further study the substrate specificity of the Fad4, a number of substrates including 18:2(9,12), 18:3(9,12,15), 20:3(8,11,14) and 22:4(7,10,13,16) were separately supplied to the yeast transformants. The results indicated Fad4 could also use 22:4 (7,10,13,16) as a substrate (Figure 9) to produce another Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DPA (22:5-4,7,10,13,16) (Figure 10). The rest of the fatty acids examined were not effective substrates. To confirm the function of Fad5 and Fad5-2, the S. cerevisiae Invsc2 was transformed with plasmids, which contain the open reading frame of the Fad5 and Fad5-2 respectively under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter. When the yeast transformants were induced by galactose in a medium containing homo-gamma- linolenic acid (HGLA, 20:3-8,11,14), an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control (Figure 11). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the fatty acid had a retention time identical to the arachidonic acid standard (AA, 20:4-5,8,11,14). To further confirm the regiochemistry of the products, the FAMEs were analyzed by GC/MS. Figure 12 indicates that the mass spectra of the new fatty acid and the AA standard are identical. These results demonstrate that Fad5 and Fad5-2 convert HGLA (20:3-8,11,13) into AA (20:4-5,8,11,14) in yeast. To further study the substrate specificity of Fad5-2, the plasmid containing Fad5-2 was transferred into another yeast strain AMY-2Œ± where olel, a Œî9 desaturase gene, is disrupted. The strain is unable to grow in minimal media without supplementation with mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In this experiment, the strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 17:1(102), a non-substrate of Fad5-2, which enabled study of the specificity of the enzyme towards various substrates, especially monounsaturates. A number of possible substrates including 16:1(9Z), 18:1(9Z), 18:1(11Z), 18:1(1 IE), 18:1(12E), 18:1(15Z), 18:2(9Z,12Z), 18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z), 20:2(11Z,14Z) and 20:3(11Z,14Z, 17Z) were tested. Results indicated that Fad5-2 could desaturate unsaturated fatty acids with Œî9 ethylenic and Œîl 1 ethylenic double bonds, as well as the fatty acid with Œî8 ethylenic double bond (20:3-8,11,14). As shown in Figure 13, Fad5-2 effectively converted both 18:1(9Z) and 18:1(11Z) substrates into their corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids, 18:2-5,9 (the retention time 10.34 min) and 18:1-5,11 (the retention time 10.44 min), respectively. Fad5-2 also desaturated trans fatty acid such as 18:1(1 IE) and 18:1(12E). Figure 25 is a comparison of substrate preference of Fad5-2 for fatty acid substrates tested in the yeast strain AMY-2Œ±. The relative proportions of the substrates and the products accumulated are a useful indicator of substrate preference of the enzyme. As shown in Figure 25, Fad5-2 prefers fatty acids with 20-carbon as substrates, such as 20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z), 20:3(1 IZ,14Z, 17Z) and 20:2(11Z,14Z). Whereas, tlie shorter chain fatty acid is a relatively weaker substrate for the enzyme in yeast. To confirm the function of Fad6, the S. cerevisiae host strain Invsc2 was transformed with a plasmid containing the open reading frame of Fad6 under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter, GAL When the yeast transformant was induced by galactose in a medium containing linoleic acid, an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of the FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control (Figure 14). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the peak had a retention time identical to the gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3-6,9,12) standard. To confirm the regioselectivity of the products, the diethylamine derivatives of fatty acids from the expressing strain were analyzed by GC-MS. Figure 15 shows that the new peak is indeed GLA with three double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions. Major fragments of n and n+1 carbons differing by 12 D are diagnostic of a double bond between carbon n+1 and n+2. Thus, the fragments at 156 and 168, 196 and 208, and 236 and 248, indicate double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions, respectively. These results demonstrate that Fad6 is a Œî6 desaturase that converts linoleic acid (18 :2) to GLA in yeast. EXAMPLE 9: EXPRESSION OF FAD4 IN B. JUNCEA To determine whether Traustochytrium Fad4 is functional in oilseed crops, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad4 under the control of a constitutive promoter. Eight independent transgenic plants were obtained. In B. juncea there is no Œî4 fatty acid desaturase substrates available. Thus, to examine the activity of the transgenic enzyme in the plants, the 22:5 (n-3) substrate must be exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium docosapentaeneate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of both types of plants, but converted into DHA only in transgenics. Leaves have a higher level of production of DHA than roots and stems. In leaves, the exogenous substrate was incorporated to a level of 10-20%) of the total fatty acids and Œî4 desaturated fatty acid (22:6, n-3) was produced in a range of 3-6% of the total fatty acids (Figure 16). These results indicate that the Œî4 fatty acid desaturase from Traustochytrium is functional in oilseed crops. EXAMPLE 10: EXPRESSION OF FAD5-2 IN B. JUNCEA To determine whether Fad5-2 is functional in oilseed crops and its expression has any effect on their growth and development, B. juncea were transformed with a binary vector that contained Fad5-2 cDNA behind a constitutive promoter (a tandem cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter). Six independent primary transgenic plants were obtained and the fatty acid profile of lipids from different tissues was determined. Figure 17 shows the fatty acid composition of three- week-old seedling plants from one T \\\\ line. Compared with wild type, all transgenic plant tissues have an altered fatty acid profile containing four additional peaks which were identified as four different Œî5-undesaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids (Œî5-UPIFAs), specifically, taxoleic (18:2-5,9); ephedrenic (18:2-5,11); pinolenic (18:3-5,9,12), and coniferonic acids (18:4-5,9,12,15). Thus B. juncea, like yeast, can functionally express the P. irregulare Œî5 desaturase to convert the endogenous substrates 18:1-9; 18:1-11; 18:2-9,12, and 18:3-9,12,15 to the corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids. The roots produced the highest amount of the Œî5-UPIFAs, representing more than 20% of the total fatty acids, followed by 6% in stems and 5% in leaves (Figure 17). In B. juncea there is no homo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3-8,11,14) substrate available. Thus, to examine whether the transgenic plant can produce AA, the substrate 20:3(8,11,14) was exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium homo-gamma- linolenate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of transgenic plants and converted into AA in plants (Figure 18). There was no observable phenotypic effect on the growth and development in the transgenic B. juncea, although the Œî5-UPIFAs accumulated in all parts of the plant. Growth and differentiation of vegetative tissues such as the leaves, stems, and roots were indistinguishable from the corresponding wild type. To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in seeds, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad5-2 cDNA behind a heterologous seed- specific promoter (B. napus napin promoter). Fatty acid analysis of transgenic seeds showed that there were two new fatty acids appearing in the gas chromatogram of transgenics compared with the wild type control (Figure 19). They were identified as taxoleic acid (18:2-5,9) and pinolenic acids (18:3-5,9,12). Together, these fatty acids represent 9.4 % of the seed fatty acids. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs has no significant effect on the oleic acid content compared with the untransformed control. EXAMPLE 11: EXPRESSION OF FAD5-2 IN FLAX To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, flax was transformed with Fad5-2 under the control of two seed-specific promoters, a heterologous B. napus napin promoter, and a flax endogenous promoter. As shown in Figure 26, transgenic plants containing the napin promoter produced one Œî5 desaturated fatty acid, taxoleic acid in seeds at the level of less than 1% of the total fatty acids. Whereas transgenic plants containing the flax seed-specific promoter produced three Œî5 desaturated fatty acids: taxoleic, pinolenic, and coniferonic acid. Of these, taxoleic (18:2-5,9) was the most abundant and accounted for more than 9% of the total fatty acids in a elite line (FN-10-1), followed by coniferonic and pinolenic acids. Surprisingly, accumulation of Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in transgenic seeds has significant impact on the composition of other fatty acids, especially the oleic acid level. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs was accompanied by a huge increase of the oleic acids in both types of transgenic plants expressing Fad5-2 desaturase under the control of the different promoters. The content of oleic acid in transgenic plants with the napin and flax seed-specific promoters, on the average, reached 44.7% and 24.3% of the total fatty acids, respectively, relative to the untransformed control at 17.4%. EXAMPLE 12: EXPRESSION OF FAD6 IN FLAX To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, two types of flax were transformed with the construct that contains Fad6 cDNA under the control of a heterologous seed-specific promoter (B. napus napin promoter). Type I flax (Normandy) is a traditional industrial oilseed crop, whereas Type II (Solin) is an edible oilseed crop derived from chemical mutagenesis of Type I. A total of twelve transgenic plants were produced. The majority of transgenics exhibited two novel fatty acids whose retention times correspond to GLA and SDA and they constitute 0.1 to 4.3 % of the total fatty acids (Figure 27). The level of GLA in transgenic Solin type is higher than that of SDA, while GLA in transgenic Normandy is lower than SDA. This is understandable because linoleic acid is a major fatty acid in Solin type linseed while - linolenic acid is a major fatty acid in Normandy seeds. EXAMPLE 13: EXPRESSION OF FAD6 IN B. JUNCEA To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in seeds of B. juncea, B. juncea were transformed with the same construct used in flax transformation, i.e., Fad6 under the control of the B. napus napin promoter. Fifteen independent transgenic plants were obtained. Fatty acid analysis of the transgenic seeds showed that there were three new fatty acids in the gas chromatogram of most transgenics compared with the wild type control (Figure 20). The three fatty acids were identified as 18:2(6,9) and 18:3(6,9,12), and 18:4(6,9,12,15). B. juncea, like flax, can also functionally express Fad6 from P. irregulare, introducing a double bond at position 6 of endogenous substrate 18:1(9), 18:2(9,12), and 18:3(6,9,12) resulting in production of three corresponding Œî6 fatty acids in the transgenic seeds. Among the three new fatty acids produced in transgenic seeds, GLA is the most abundant one, with a level in transgenic seeds of 30% to 38% of the total fatty acids. The next most abundant component is SDA, which accounts for 3- 10 % of the total fatty acids in several transgenic lines (Figure 21). The fatty acid compositions of transgenic seeds are shown in Figure 22. It is clear that the high level production of Œî6 desaturated fatty acids is at the cost of two major fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acids. Proportions of oleic and stearic acids in transgenics are slightly reduced, but not significantly compared to those in the wild type control. The content of linoleic acid in the transgenics was dramatically reduced. In the untransformed wild type, linoleic acid accounts for more than 40% of the total fatty acids in seeds. In transgenics, the level was reduced to less than 10%. As compared to the reduction of linoleic acid in transgenics, the decrease in linolenic acid in transgenics is less dramatic, but still significant. In the untransformed wild type, linolenic acid accounts for more than 10% of the total fatty acids in seeds while in transgenics the level was reduced to less than 5%. The two dramatically reduced fatty acids in transgenic seeds are the substrates of the Œî6 desaturase, and the reduction is the cost for producing two corresponding Œî6 desaturated fatty acids.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fatty acids are carboxylic acids with long-chain hydrocarbon side groups and play a fundamental role in many biological processes. Fatty acids are rarely free in nature but, rather, occur in esterified form as the major component of lipids. Lipids/fatty acids are sources of energy (e.g., b-oxidation) and are an integral part of cell membranes which are indispensable for processing biological or biochemical information. Fatty acids can be divided into two groups: the saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids which contain one or more carbon double bond in cis-configuration. Unsaturated fatty acids are produced by terminal desaturases that belong to the class of nonheme-iron enzymes. Each of these enzymes are part of a electron-transport system that contains two other proteins, namely cytochrome b 5 and NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. Human and other mammals have a limited spectrum of these desaturases that are required for the formation of particular double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, humans have to take up some fatty acids through their diet. Such essential fatty acids, for example, are linoleic acid (C18:2); linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4). In contrast, insects and plants are able to synthesize a much larger variety of unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19)) are essential components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). For example, over 30% of fatty acids in brain phospholipid are 22:6 (n-3) and 20:4 (n-6). (Crawford, M. A., et al., (1997) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66:1032S-1041S). In retina, DHA accounts for more than 60% of the total fatty acids in the rod outer segment, the photosensitive part of the photoreceptor cell. (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has significant effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, some positive effects of DHA were also found on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Therefore, the appropriate dietary supply of the fatty acid is important for humans to remain healthy. It is particularly important for infant, young children and senior citizens to adequately intake these fatty acids from the diet since they cannot be efficiently synthesized in their body and must be supplemented by food (Spector, A. A. (1999) Lipids 34:S1-S3). DHA is a fatty acid of the n-3 series according to the location of the last double bond in the methyl end. It is synthesized via alternating steps of desaturation and elongation. Starting with 18:3 (9, 12, 15), biosynthesis of DHA involves Œî6 desaturation to 18:4 (6, 9, 12, 15), followed by elongation to 20:4 (8, 11, 14, 17) and Œî5 desaturation to 20:5 (5, 8, 11, 14, 17). Beyond this point, there are some controversies about the biosynthesis. The conventional view is that 20:5 (5, 8, 11, 14, 17) is elongated to 22:5 (7, 10, 13, 16, 19) and then converted to 22:6 (4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19) by the final Œî4 desaturation (Horrobin, D. F. (1992) Prog. Lipid Res. 31:163-194). However, Sprecher et al. recently suggested an alternative pathway for DHA biosynthesis, which is independent of Œî4 desaturase, involving two consecutive elongations, a Œî6 desaturation and a two-carbon shortening via limited n-oxidation in peroxisome (Sprecher, H., et al. (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36:2471-2477; Sprecher, H., et al. (1999) Lipids 34:S153-S156). Production of DHA is important because of its beneficial effect on human health. Currently the major sources of DHA are oils from fish and algae. Fish oil is a major and traditional source for this fatty acid, however, it is usually oxidized by the time it is sold. In addition, the supply of the oil is highly variable and its source is in jeopardy with the shrinking fish populations while the algal source is expensive due to low yield and the high costs of extraction. EPA and AA are both Œî5 essential fatty acids. They form a unique class of food and feed constituents for humans and animals. EPA belongs to the n-3 series with five double bonds in the acyl chain, is found in marine food, and is abundant in oily fish from North Atlantic. AA belongs to the n-6 series with four double bonds. The lack of a double bond in the œâ-3 position confers on AA different properties than those found in EPA. The eicosanoids produced from AA have strong inflammatory and platelet aggregating properties, whereas those derived from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet aggregating properties. AA can be obtained from some foods such as meat, fish, and eggs, but the concentration is low. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is another essential fatty acid found in mammals. GLA is the metabolic intermediate for very long chain n-6 fatty acids and for various active molecules. In mammals, formation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is rate-limited by Œî6 desaturation. Many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, stress, diabetes, eczema, and some infections have been shown to depress the Œî6 desaturation step. In addition, GLA is readily catabolized from the oxidation and rapid cell division associated with certain disorders, e.g., cancer or inflammation. Therefore, dietary supplementation with GLA can reduce the risks of these disorders. Clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation with GLA is effective in treating some pathological conditions such as atopic eczema, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders. The predominant sources of GLA are oils from plants such as evening primrose ( Oenothera biennis ), borage ( Borago officinalis L.), black currant ( Ribes nigrum ), and from microorganisms such as Mortierella sp., Mucor sp., and Cyanobacteria . However, these GLA sources are not ideal for dietary supplementation due to large fluctuations in availability and costs associated with extraction processes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The biosynthesis of fatty acids is a major activity of plants and microorganisms. However, humans have a limited capacity for synthesizing essential fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Biotechnology has long been considered an efficient way to manipulate the process of producing fatty acids in plants and microorganisms. It is cost-effective and renewable with little side effects. Thus, tremendous industrial effort directed to the production of various compounds including speciality fatty acids and pharmaceutical polypeptides through the manipulation of plant, animal, and microorganismal cells has ensued. Accordingly, biotechnology is an attractive route for producing unsaturated fatty acids, especially LCPUFAs, in a safe, cost-efficient manner so as to garner the maximum therapeutic value from these fatty acids. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a family of nucleic acid molecules encoding novel desaturases. In particular, the present inventors have identified the Fad 4 (Œî4 desaturase), Fad5 and Fad5-2 (Œî5 desaturase), and Fad6 (Œî6 desaturase) which are involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6, n-3) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5, n-6); more specifically, Fad4 desaturases 22:5 (n-3) and 22:4 (n-6) resulting in DHA and DPA; Fad5 and Fad5-2 desaturases 20:4 (n-3) and 20:3(n-6) resulting in EPA and AA; and Fad6 desaturases 18:2 (n-6) and 18:3(n-3) resulting in GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) and SDA (stearidonic acid).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of novel fatty acid desaturase family members, referred to interchangeably herein as ‚Äúdesaturases‚Äù or ‚Äúdesaturase‚Äù nucleic acid and protein molecules (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6). These novel molecules are members of the fatty acid desaturase family and are expressed in LCPUFAs-producing organisms, e.g., Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare, Schizichytrium , and Crythecodinium. As used herein, the term ‚Äúfatty acids‚Äù is art recognized and includes a long-chain hydrocarbon based carboxylic acid. Fatty acids are components of many lipids including glycerides. The most common naturally occurring fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids which have an even number of carbon atoms (16 or 18) and which may be saturated or unsaturated. ‚ÄúUnsaturated‚Äù fatty acids contain cis double bonds between the carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids encompassed by the present invention include, for example, DHA, GLA, and SDA. ‚ÄúPolyunsaturated‚Äù fatty acids contain more than one double bond and the double bonds are arranged in a methylene interrupted system (‚ÄîCH‚ïêCH‚ÄîCH 2 ‚ÄîCH‚ïêCH‚Äî). Fatty acids are described herein by a numbering system in which the number before the colon indicates the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, whereas the number after the colon is the number of double bonds that are present. In the case of unsaturated fatty acids, this is followed by a number in parentheses that indicates the position of the double bonds. Each number in parenthesis is the lower numbered carbon atom of the two connected by the double bond. For example, oleic acid can be described as 18:1(9) and linoleic acid can be described as 18:2(9, 12) indicating 18 carbons, one double bond at carbon 9, two double bonds at carbons 9 and 12, respectively. The controlling steps in the production of unsaturated fatty acids, i.e., the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, are catalyzed by membrane-associated fatty acid desaturases, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. As used herein, the term ‚Äúunsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway‚Äù refers to a series of chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of an unsaturated fatty acid either in vivo or in vitro. Such a pathway includes a series of desaturation and elongation steps which generate unsaturated fatty acids and ultimately, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Such unsaturated fatty acids can include, GLA 18:3 (6, 9, 12), SDA 18:4 (6, 9, 12, 15), AA 20:4 (5, 8, 11, 14), EPA 20:5 (5, 8, 11, 14, 17), and DPA 22:5 (4, 7, 10, 13, 16), and DHA 22:6 (4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19). Desaturases can contain a heme-binding motif and/or about three conservative histidine motifs, although additional domains may be present. Members of the fatty acid desaturase family convert saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), which are components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). Examples of LCPUFA include, among others, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19)). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, positive effects of DHA were also found in the treatment of diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Thus, the desaturase molecules can be used to produce the LCPUFAs useful in treating disorders characterized by aberrantly regulated growth, proliferation, or differentiation. Such disorders include cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, or leukemia; tumor angiogenesis and metastasis; skeletal dysplasia; hepatic disorders; myelodysplastic syndromes; and hematopoietic and/or myeloproliferative disorders. Other disorders related to angiogenesis and which are, therefore, desaturase associated disorders include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. The term ‚Äúfamily‚Äù when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention is intended to mean two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin or alternatively, can contain homologues of non-human origin, e.g., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. For example, the family of desaturase proteins of the present invention comprises one cytochrome b5 heme-binding motif. As used herein, the term ‚Äúheme-binding motif‚Äù is an N-terminal extension of the cytochrome b5-like domain found in front-end desaturases. In another embodiment, members of the desaturase family of proteins include a ‚Äúhistidine motifs‚Äù in the protein, preferably, about three or four histidine motifs. As used herein, the term ‚Äúhistidine motif‚Äù includes a protein domain having at least about two histidine amino acid residues, preferably about three or four histidine amino acid residues, and is typically found in all microsomal desaturases as the third conservative histidine motif. Examples of cytochrome b5 heme-binding motifs and histidine motifs include amino acid residues 41-44, 182-186, 216-223, and 453-462 of SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 40-43, 171-175, 207-213, and 375-384 of SEQ ID NO:4, amino acid residues 40-45, 171-176, 208-213, and 395-400 of SEQ ID NO:6, and amino acid residues 42-47, 178-183, 215-220, and 400-405 of SEQ ID NO:8, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 6 . Isolated desaturase proteins of the present invention have an amino acid sequence sufficiently homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 or are encoded by a nucleotide sequence sufficiently homologous to SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5 or 7. As used herein, the term ‚Äúsufficiently homologous‚Äù refers to a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence which contains a sufficient or minimum number of identical or equivalent (e.g., an amino acid residue which has a similar side chain) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleotide sequences share common structural domains or motifs and/or a common functional activity. For example, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share common structural domains having at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity across the amino acid sequences of the domains and contain at least one and preferably two structural domains or motifs, are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. Furthermore, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity and share a common functional activity are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains or motifs: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif and has an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous or identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif, and is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one heme-binding motif and/or at least about three histidine motifs, and has a desaturase activity. As used interchangeably herein, a ‚Äúdesaturase activity,‚Äù ‚Äúbiological activity of a desaturase,‚Äù or ‚Äúfunctional activity of a desaturase,‚Äù includes an activity exerted or mediated by a desaturase protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on a desaturase responsive cell or on a desaturase substrate, as determined in vivo or in vitro, according to standard techniques. In one embodiment, a desaturase activity is a direct activity such as an association with a desaturase target molecule. As used herein, a ‚Äútarget molecule‚Äù or ‚Äúbinding partner‚Äù is a molecule e.g., a molecule involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, with which a desaturase protein binds or interacts in nature such that a desaturase-mediated function is achieved. A desaturase direct activity also includes the formation of a double bond between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule to form an unsaturated fatty acid molecule. The nucleotide sequence of the isolated Thraustochytrium sp. Œî4 desaturase, Fad4, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad4 cDNA are shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B and in SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad4 gene (the open reading frame), which is approximately 1560 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 59.1 kD and which is approximately 519 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Thraustochytrium sp. Œî5 desaturase, Fad5, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5 cDNA are shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B and in SEQ ID NOs:3 and 4, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad5 gene, which is approximately 1320 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 49.8 kD and which is approximately 439 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî 5 desaturase, Fad5-2, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5-2 cDNA are shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B and in SEQ ID NOs:5 and 6, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad5-2 gene, which is approximately 1371 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 456 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî6 desaturase, Fad6, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad6 cDNA are shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B and in SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad6 gene, which is approximately 1383 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 460 amino acid residues in length. Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections: I. Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode desaturase proteins or biologically active portions thereof, as well as nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify desaturase-encoding nucleic acid molecules (e.g., desaturase mRNA) and fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of desaturase nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term ‚Äúnucleic acid molecule‚Äù is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. The term ‚Äúisolated nucleic acid molecule‚Äù includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term ‚Äúisolated‚Äù includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an ‚Äúisolated‚Äù nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated desaturase nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an ‚Äúisolated‚Äù nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, e.g., a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, or a portion thereof, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information provided herein. Using all or a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, as hybridization probes, desaturase nucleic acid molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook, J. et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd , ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule encompassing all or a portion of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, can be isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed based upon the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A nucleic acid of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to desaturase nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule consists of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, or a portion of any of these nucleotide sequences. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 is one which is sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that it can hybridize to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby forming a stable duplex. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 (e.g., to the entire length of the nucleotide sequence), or a portion or complement of any of these nucleotide sequences. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least (or no greater than) 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-750, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. Moreover, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, a fragment which can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding a portion of a desaturase protein, e.g., a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein. The nucleotide sequence determined from the cloning of the desaturase gene allows for the generation of probes and primers designed for use in identifying and/or cloning other desaturase family members, as well as desaturase homologues from other species. The probe/primer (e.g., oligonucleotide) typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 12 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 75 consecutive nucleotides of a sense sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5 or 7, of an anti-sense sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or of a naturally occurring allelic variant or mutant of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Exemplary probes or primers are at least (or no greater than) 12 or 15, 20 or 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or more nucleotides in length and/or comprise consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein. Also included within the scope of the present invention are probes or primers comprising contiguous or consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein, but for the difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases within the probe or primer sequence. Probes based on the desaturase nucleotide sequences can be used to detect (e.g., specifically detect) transcripts or genomic sequences encoding the same or homologous proteins. In preferred embodiments, the probe further comprises a label group attached thereto, e.g., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. In another embodiment a set of primers is provided, e.g., primers suitable for use in a PCR, which can be used to amplify a selected region of a desaturase sequence, e.g., a domain, region, site or other sequence described herein. The primers should be at least 5, 10, or 50 base pairs in length and less than 100, or less than 200, base pairs in length. The primers should be identical, or differ by no greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases when compared to a sequence disclosed herein or to the sequence of a naturally occurring variant. Such probes can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissue which misexpress a desaturase protein, such as by measuring a level of a desaturase-encoding nucleic acid in a sample of cells from a subject, e.g., detecting desaturase mRNA levels or determining whether a genomic desaturase gene has been mutated or deleted. A nucleic acid fragment encoding a ‚Äúbiologically active portion of a desaturase protein‚Äù can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, which encodes a polypeptide having a desaturase biological activity (the biological activities of the desaturase proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the desaturase protein (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro) and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the desaturase protein. In an exemplary embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and encodes a protein having a desaturase activity (as described herein). The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same desaturase proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs by at least 1, but no greater than 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 amino acid residues from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the amino acid sequence of human desaturase. If an alignment is needed for this comparison, the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. Nucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologues (different locus), and orthologues (different organism) or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product). Allelic variants result, for example, from DNA sequence polymorphisms within a population (e.g., the human population) that lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the desaturase proteins. Such genetic polymorphism in the desaturase genes may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. As used herein, the terms ‚Äúgene‚Äù and ‚Äúrecombinant gene‚Äù refer to nucleic acid molecules which include an open reading frame encoding a desaturase protein, e.g., oilseed desaturase protein, and can further include non-coding regulatory sequences, and introns. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a naturally occurring allelic variant of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, wherein the nucleic acid molecule hybridizes to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions. Allelic variants of desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, include both functional and non-functional desaturase proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein that maintain the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., a fatty acid, e.g., 22:5(n-3)); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. The fatty acids produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention are also useful in treating disorders such as aging, stress, diabetes, cancer, inflammatory disorders (e.g., arthritis, eczema), and cardiovascular disorders. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only a conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Non-functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, that do not have the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, such as 18:4(6, 9, 12, 15)); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. The present invention further provides orthologues (e.g., human orthologues of the desaturase proteins). Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins are proteins that are isolated from other organisms and possess the same desaturase substrate or target molecule binding mechanisms, double bond forming mechanisms, modulating mechanisms of growth and development of the brain in infants, maintenance mechanisms of normal brain function in adults, ability to affect photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, ability to affect rhodopsin activation, development mechanisms of rods and/or cones, and/or modulating mechanisms of cellular growth and/or proliferation of the non-human desaturase proteins. Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins can readily be identified as comprising an amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other desaturase family members and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, another desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins from different species, and which, thus, have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, Schizochytrium or Crythecodinium desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the desaturase cDNAs of the invention can be isolated based on their homology to the desaturase nucleic acids disclosed herein using the cDNAs disclosed herein, or a portion thereof, as a hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent hybridization conditions. Orthologues, homologues and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art (e.g., by hybridization to an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions). In one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention is at least 15, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In other embodiment, the nucleic acid is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length. As used herein, the term ‚Äúhybridizes under stringent conditions‚Äù is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences that are significantly identical or homologous to each other remain hybridized to each other. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% identical to each other remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc . (1995), sections 2, 4, and 6. Additional stringent conditions can be found in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual , Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), chapters 7, 9, and 11. A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4√ó sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 4√óSSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 1√óSSC, at about 65-70¬∞ C. A preferred, non-limiting example of highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 1√óSSC, at about 65-70¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 1√óSSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 0.3√óSSC, at about 65-70¬∞ C. A preferred, non-limiting example of reduced stringency hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4√óSSC, at about 50-60¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 6√óSSC plus 50% formamide at about 40-45¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 2√óSSC, at about 50-60¬∞ C. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values, e.g., at 65-70¬∞ C. or at 42-50¬∞ C. are also intended to be encompassed by the present invention. SSPE (1√óSSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1√óSSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-10¬∞ C. less than the melting temperature MO of the hybrid, where T m is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞ C.)=2(# of A+T bases)+4(# of G+C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞ C.)=81.5+16.6(log 10 [Na + ]) 0.41(% G+C)‚àí(600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na + ] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer ([Na + ] for 1√óSSC=0.165 M). It will also be recognized by the skilled practitioner that additional reagents may be added to hybridization and/or wash buffers to decrease non-specific hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to membranes, for example, nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, including but not limited to blocking agents (e.g., BSA or salmon or herring sperm carrier DNA), detergents (e.g., SDS), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA), Ficoll, PVP and the like. When using nylon membranes, in particular, an additional preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 0.25-0.5M NaH 2 PO 4 , 7% SDS at about 65¬∞ C., followed by one or more washes at 0.02M NaH 2 PO 4 , 1% SDS at 65¬∞ C. (see e.g., Church and Gilbert (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1991-1995), or alternatively 0.2√óSSC, 1% SDS. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a ‚Äúnaturally-occurring‚Äù nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature (e.g., encodes a natural protein). In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of the desaturase sequences that may exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by mutation into the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded desaturase proteins, without altering the functional ability of the desaturase proteins. For example, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù amino acid residues can be made in the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 (e.g., the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8) without altering the biological activity, whereas an ‚Äúessential‚Äù amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the desaturase proteins of the present invention, e.g., those present in a heme-binding motif or a histidine motif, are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. Furthermore, additional amino acid residues that are conserved between the desaturase proteins of the present invention and other members of the fatty acid desaturase family are not likely to be amenable to alteration. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such desaturase proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, yet retain biological activity. In one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, wherein the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% 99% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, e.g., to the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a desaturase protein homologous to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A ‚Äúconservative amino acid substitution‚Äù is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a desaturase protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a desaturase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for desaturase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. In a preferred embodiment, a mutant desaturase protein can be assayed for the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. II. Isolated Desaturase Proteins One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated or recombinant desaturase proteins and polypeptides, and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment, native desaturase proteins can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, desaturase proteins are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a desaturase protein or polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. An ‚Äúisolated‚Äù or ‚Äúpurified‚Äù protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the desaturase protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of cellular material‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language ‚Äúsubstantially free of cellular material‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, or 30% (by dry weight) of non-desaturase protein (also referred to herein as a ‚Äúcontaminating protein‚Äù), more preferably less than about 20% of non-desaturase protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-desaturase protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-desaturase protein. When the desaturase protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language ‚Äúsubstantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals. It should be understood that the proteins or this invention can also be in a form which is different than their corresponding naturally occurring proteins and/or which is still in association with at least some cellular components. For example, the protein can be associated with a cellular membrane. As used herein, a ‚Äúbiologically active portion‚Äù of a desaturase protein includes a fragment of a desaturase protein which participates in an interaction between a desaturase molecule and a non-desaturase molecule (e.g., a desaturase substrate such as fatty acid). Biologically active portions of a desaturase protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the desaturase amino acid sequences, e.g., the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 which include sufficient amino acid residues to exhibit at least one activity of a desaturase protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the desaturase protein; the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. A biologically active portion of a desaturase protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200 or more amino acids in length. In one embodiment, a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein comprises a heme-binding motif and/or at least one histidine motifs, preferably about three histidine motifs. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native desaturase protein. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In other embodiments, the desaturase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, yet differs in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. In another embodiment, the desaturase protein is a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In another embodiment, the invention features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. This invention further features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the length of the reference sequence (e.g., when aligning a second sequence to the Fad4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 having 519 amino acid residues, at least 156, preferably at least 208, more preferably at least 260, even more preferably at least 311, and even more preferably at least 363, 415, or 467 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 having 439 amino acid residues, at least 132, preferably at least 176, more preferably at least 220, even more preferably at least 263, and even more preferably at least 307, 351, or 395 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5-2 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 having 456 amino acid residues, at least 137, preferably at least 182, more preferably at least 228, even more preferably at least 273, and even more preferably at least 319, 365, or 419 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad6 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8 having 460 amino acid residues, at least 138, preferably at least 184, more preferably at least 230, even more preferably at least 276, and even more preferably at least 322, 368, or 414 amino acid residues are aligned). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid ‚Äúidentity‚Äù is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid ‚Äúhomology‚Äù). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch ( J. Mol. Biol . (48):444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package, using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A preferred, non-limiting example of parameters to be used in conjunction with the GAP program include a Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller ( Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:11-17 (1988)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0 or version 2.0U), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a ‚Äúquery sequence‚Äù to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to desaturase nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to desaturase protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. III. Methods of Producing Unsaturated Fatty Acids The present invention provides new and improved methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., LCPUFAs, such as, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 (n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 (n-6)), AA (Arachidonic acid, 20:4 (n-6)) and EPA (eicosapentaenioc acid, 20:5(n-3)). A. Recombinant Cells and Methods for Culturing Cells The present invention further features recombinant vectors that include nucleic acid sequences that encode the gene products as described herein, preferably Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 gene products. The term recombinant vector includes a vector (e.g., plasmid) that has been altered, modified or engineered such that it contains greater, fewer or different nucleic acid sequences than those included in the native vector or plasmid. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector includes the nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one fatty acid desaturase enzyme operably linked to regulatory sequences. The phrase ‚Äúoperably linked to regulatory sequence(s)‚Äù means that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression (e.g., enhanced, increased, constitutive, basal, attenuated, decreased or repressed expression) of the nucleotide sequence, preferably expression of a gene product encoded by the nucleotide sequence (e.g., when the recombinant vector is introduced into a cell). Exemplary vectors are described in further detail herein as well as in, for example, Frascotti et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,137, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The term ‚Äúregulatory sequence‚Äù includes nucleic acid sequences which affect (e.g., modulate or regulate) expression of other (non-regulatory) nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence is included in a recombinant vector in a similar or identical position and/or orientation relative to a particular gene of interest as is observed for the regulatory sequence and gene of interest as it appears in nature, e.g., in a native position and/or orientation. For example, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to the gene in the natural organism (e.g., operably linked to ‚Äúnative‚Äù Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequence (e.g., to the ‚Äúnative‚Äù Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 promoter). Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to another (e.g., a different) gene in the natural organism. For example, a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene can be included in a vector operably linked to non-Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequences. Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence from another organism. For example, regulatory sequences from other microbes (e.g., other bacterial regulatory sequences, bacteriophage regulatory sequences and the like) can be operably linked to a particular gene of interest. Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers, termination signals and other expression control elements (e.g., binding sites for transcriptional and/or translational regulatory proteins, for example, in the transcribed mRNA). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., constitutive promoters and strong constitutive promoters), those which direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., inducible promoters, for example, xylose inducible promoters) and those which attenuate or repress expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., attenuation signals or repressor sequences). It is also within the scope of the present invention to regulate expression of a gene of interest by removing or deleting regulatory sequences. For example, sequences involved in the negative regulation of transcription can be removed such that expression of a gene of interest is enhanced. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes nucleic acid sequences that encode at least one gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) operably linked to a promoter or promoter sequence. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes a terminator sequence or terminator sequences (e.g., transcription terminator sequences). The term ‚Äúterminator sequences‚Äù includes regulatory sequences which serve to terminate transcription of mRNA. Terminator sequences (or tandem transcription terminators) can further serve to stabilize mRNA (e.g., by adding structure to mRNA), for example, against nucleases. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes antibiotic resistance sequences. The term ‚Äúantibiotic resistance sequences‚Äù includes sequences which promote or confer resistance to antibiotics on the host organism. In one embodiment, the antibiotic resistance sequences are selected from the group consisting of cat (chloramphenicol resistance), tet (tetracycline resistance) sequences, erm (erythromycin resistance) sequences, neo (neomycin resistance) sequences and spec (spectinomycin resistance) sequences. Recombinant vectors of the present invention can further include homologous recombination sequences (e.g., sequences designed to allow recombination of the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host organism). For example, amyE sequences can be used as homology targets for recombination into the host chromosome. The term ‚Äúmanipulated cell‚Äù includes a cell that has been engineered (e.g., genetically engineered) or modified such that the cell has at least one fatty acid desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6, such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced. Modification or engineering of such microorganisms can be according to any methodology described herein including, but not limited to, deregulation of a biosynthetic pathway and/or overexpression of at least one biosynthetic enzyme. A ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù enzyme (e.g., a ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù biosynthetic enzyme) includes an enzyme, the expression or production of which has been altered or modified such that at least one upstream or downstream precursor, substrate or product of the enzyme is altered or modified, for example, as compared to a corresponding wild-type or naturally occurring enzyme. The term ‚Äúoverexpressed‚Äù or ‚Äúoverexpression‚Äù includes expression of a gene product (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase) at a level greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. In one embodiment, the cell can be genetically manipulated (e.g., genetically engineered) to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. Genetic manipulation can include, but is not limited to, altering or modifying regulatory sequences or sites associated with expression of a particular gene (e.g., by adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or by removing regulatory sequences such that expression is constitutive), modifying the chromosomal location of a particular gene, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to a particular gene such as a ribosome binding site or transcription terminator, increasing the copy number of a particular gene, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of a particular gene routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). In another embodiment, the cell can be physically or environmentally manipulated to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. For example, a cell can be treated with or cultured in the presence of an agent known or suspected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. Alternatively, a cell can be cultured at a temperature selected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. The term ‚Äúderegulated‚Äù or ‚Äúderegulation‚Äù includes the alteration or modification of at least one gene in a cell that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway, such that the level or activity of the biosynthetic enzyme in the cell is altered or modified. Preferably, at least one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the gene product is enhanced or increased. The phrase ‚Äúderegulated pathway‚Äù can also include a biosynthetic pathway in which more than one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the level or activity of more than one biosynthetic enzyme is altered or modified. The ability to ‚Äúderegulate‚Äù a pathway (e.g., to simultaneously deregulate more than one gene in a given biosynthetic pathway) in a cell arises from the particular phenomenon of cells in which more than one enzyme (e.g., two or three biosynthetic enzymes) are encoded by genes occurring adjacent to one another on a contiguous piece of genetic material termed an ‚Äúoperon‚Äù. The term ‚Äúoperon‚Äù includes a coordinated unit of gene expression that contains a promoter and possibly a regulatory element associated with one or more, preferably at least two, structural genes (e.g., genes encoding enzymes, for example, biosynthetic enzymes). Expression of the structural genes can be coordinately regulated, for example, by regulatory proteins binding to the regulatory element or by anti-termination of transcription. The structural genes can be transcribed to give a single mRNA that encodes all of the structural proteins. Due to the coordinated regulation of genes included in an operon, alteration or modification of the single promoter and/or regulatory element can result in alteration or modification of each gene product encoded by the operon. Alteration or modification of the regulatory element can include, but is not limited to removing the endogenous promoter and/or regulatory element(s), adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or removing regulatory sequences such that expression of the gene products is modified, modifying the chromosomal location of the operon, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the operon or within the operon such as a ribosome binding site, increasing the copy number of the operon, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of the operon and/or translation of the gene products of the operon, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of genes routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). Deregulation can also involve altering the coding region of one or more genes to yield, for example, an enzyme that is feedback resistant or has a higher or lower specific activity. A particularly preferred ‚Äúrecombinant‚Äù cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a plant-derived gene or gene product or an microorganismally-derived gene or gene product. The term ‚Äúplant-derived,‚Äù ‚Äúmicroorganismally-derived,‚Äù or ‚Äúderived-from,‚Äù for example, includes a gene which is naturally found in a microorganism or a plant, e.g., an oilseed plant, or a gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) or which is encoded by a plant gene or a gene from a microorganism (e.g., encoded SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7). The methodologies of the present invention feature recombinant cells which overexpress at least one fatty acid desaturase. In one embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Thrauschytrium sp. fatty acid desaturase (e.g., has been engineered to overexpress at least one of Thrauschytrium sp. Œî4 or Œî5 desaturase (the Fad4 or Fad5 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or 4 or encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3). In another embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Pythium irregulare Œî 5 or Œî6 desaturase (the Fad5-2 or Fad6 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8 or encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 or 7). In another embodiment, the invention features a cell (e.g., a microbial cell) that has been transformed with a vector comprising a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7). Another aspect of the present invention features a method of modulating the production of fatty acids comprising culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., a desaturase) such that modulation of fatty acid production occurs (e.g., production of unsaturated fatty acids is enhanced). The method of culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6) to modulate the production of fatty acids is referred to herein as ‚Äúbiotransformation.‚Äù The biotransformation processes can utilize recombinant cells and/or desaturases described herein. The term ‚Äúbiotransformation process,‚Äù also referred to herein as ‚Äúbioconversion processes,‚Äù includes biological processes which result in the production (e.g., transformation or conversion) of any compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is upstream of a fatty acid desaturase to a compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is downstream of a fatty acid desaturase, in particular, an unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of an unsaturated fatty acid comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses at least one fatty acid desaturase with at least one appropriate substrate under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced and, optionally, recovering the fatty acid. In a preferred embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of unsaturated fatty acids comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 with an appropriate substrate (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid) under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA, SDA, or GLA) is produced and, optionally, recovering the unsaturated fatty acid. Conditions under which an unsaturated fatty acid is produced can include any conditions which result in the desired production of an unsaturated fatty acid. The cell(s) and/or enzymes used in the biotransformation reactions are in a form allowing them to perform their intended function (e.g., producing a desired fatty acids). The cells can be whole cells, or can be only those portions of the cells necessary to obtain the desired end result. The cells can be suspended (e.g., in an appropriate solution such as buffered solutions or media), rinsed (e.g., rinsed free of media from culturing the cell), acetone-dried, immobilized (e.g., with polyacrylamide gel or k-carrageenan or on synthetic supports, for example, beads, matrices and the like), fixed, cross-linked or permeablized (e.g., have permeablized membranes and/or walls such that compounds, for example, substrates, intermediates or products can more easily pass through said membrane or wall). The type of cell can be any cell capable of being used within the methods of the invention, e.g., plant, animal, or microbial cells. An important aspect of the present invention involves growing the recombinant plant or culturing the recombinant microorganisms described herein, such that a desired compound (e.g., a desired unsaturated fatty acid) is produced. The term ‚Äúculturing‚Äù includes maintaining and/or growing a living microorganism of the present invention (e.g., maintaining and/or growing a culture or strain). In one embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in liquid media. In another embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in solid media or semi-solid media. In a preferred embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in media (e.g., a sterile, liquid media) comprising nutrients essential or beneficial to the maintenance and/or growth of the microorganism (e.g., carbon sources or carbon substrate, for example complex carbohydrates such as bean or grain meal, starches, sugars, sugar alcohols, hydrocarbons, oils, fats, fatty acids, organic acids and alcohols; nitrogen sources, for example, vegetable proteins, peptones, peptides and amino acids derived from grains, beans and tubers, proteins, peptides and amino acids derived form animal sources such as meat, milk and animal byproducts such as peptones, meat extracts and casein hydrolysates; inorganic nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate; phosphorus sources, for example, phosphoric acid, sodium and potassium salts thereof; trace elements, for example, magnesium, iron, manganese, calcium, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum, and/or cobalt salts; as well as growth factors such as amino acids, vitamins, growth promoters and the like). Preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled pH. The term ‚Äúcontrolled pH‚Äù includes any pH which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of about 7. In another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.5. The desired pH may be maintained by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art. Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled aeration. The term ‚Äúcontrolled aeration‚Äù includes sufficient aeration (e.g., oxygen) to result in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, aeration is controlled by regulating oxygen levels in the culture, for example, by regulating the amount of oxygen dissolved in culture media. Preferably, aeration of the culture is controlled by agitating the culture. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the growth vessel (e.g., fermentor) or by various pumping equipment. Aeration may be further controlled by the passage of sterile air or oxygen through the medium (e.g., through the fermentation mixture). Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured without excess foaming (e.g., via addition of antifoaming agents). Moreover, plants or microorganisms of the present invention can be cultured under controlled temperatures. The term ‚Äúcontrolled temperature‚Äù includes any temperature which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞ C. and 95¬∞ C. In another embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞ C. and 70¬∞ C. Preferred temperatures are between 20¬∞ C. and 55¬∞ C., more preferably between 30¬∞ C. and 45¬∞ C. or between 30¬∞ C. and 50¬∞ C. Microorganisms can be cultured (e.g., maintained and/or grown) in liquid media and preferably are cultured, either continuously or intermittently, by conventional culturing methods such as standing culture, test tube culture, shaking culture (e.g., rotary shaking culture, shake flask culture, etc.), aeration spinner culture, or fermentation. In a preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in shake flasks. In a more preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in a fermentor (e.g., a fermentation process). Fermentation processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, batch, fed-batch and continuous methods of fermentation. The phrase ‚Äúbatch process‚Äù or ‚Äúbatch fermentation‚Äù refers to a closed system in which the composition of media, nutrients, supplemental additives and the like is set at the beginning of the fermentation and not subject to alteration during the fermentation, however, attempts may be made to control such factors as pH and oxygen concentration to prevent excess media acidification and/or microorganism death. The phrase ‚Äúfed-batch process‚Äù or ‚Äúfed-batch‚Äù fermentation refers to a batch fermentation with the exception that one or more substrates or supplements are added (e.g., added in increments or continuously) as the fermentation progresses. The phrase ‚Äúcontinuous process‚Äù or ‚Äúcontinuous fermentation‚Äù refers to a system in which a defined fermentation media is added continuously to a fermentor and an equal amount of used or ‚Äúconditioned‚Äù media is simultaneously removed, preferably for recovery of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). A variety of such processes have been developed and are well-known in the art. The phrase ‚Äúculturing under conditions such that a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid, for example, DHA) is produced‚Äù includes maintaining and/or growing plants or microorganisms under conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, duration, etc.) appropriate or sufficient to obtain production of the desired compound or to obtain desired yields of the particular compound being produced. For example, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to produce the desired amount of a unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA). Preferably, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to substantially reach maximal production of the unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, culturing is continued for about 12 to 24 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for about 24 to 36 hours, 36 to 48 hours, 48 to 72 hours, 72 to 96 hours, 96 to 120 hours, 120 to 144 hours, or greater than 144 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to reach production yields of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, cells are cultured such that at least about 15 to 20 g/L of unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 20 to 25 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 25 to 30 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 30 to 35 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 35 to 40 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced (e.g., at least about 37 g/L unsaturated fatty acids) or at least about 40 to 50 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced. In yet another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured under conditions such that a preferred yield of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, a yield within a range set forth above, is produced in about 24 hours, in about 36 hours, in about 48 hours, in about 72 hours, or in about 96 hours. In producing unsaturated fatty acids, it may further be desirable to culture cells of the present invention in the presence of supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates. The term ‚Äúsupplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrate‚Äù includes an agent or compound which, when brought into contact with a cell or included in the culture medium of a cell, serves to enhance or increase unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added in the form of a concentrated solution or suspension (e.g., in a suitable solvent such as water or buffer) or in the form of a solid (e.g., in the form of a powder). Moreover, supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added as a single aliquot, continuously or intermittently over a given period of time. The methodology of the present invention can further include a step of recovering a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). The term ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù a desired compound includes extracting, harvesting, isolating or purifying the compound from culture media. Recovering the compound can be performed according to any conventional isolation or purification methodology known in the art including, but not limited to, treatment with a conventional resin (e.g., anion or cation exchange resin, non-ionic adsorption resin, etc.), treatment with a conventional adsorbent (e.g., activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina, etc.), alteration of pH, solvent extraction (e.g., with a conventional solvent such as an alcohol, ethyl acetate, hexane and the like), dialysis, filtration, concentration, crystallization, recrystallization, pH adjustment, lyophilization and the like. For example, a compound can be recovered from culture media by first removing the microorganisms from the culture. Media is then passed through or over a cation exchange resin to remove unwanted cations and then through or over an anion exchange resin to remove unwanted inorganic anions and organic acids having stronger acidities than the unsaturated fatty acid of interest (e.g., DHA). Preferably, a desired compound of the present invention is ‚Äúextracted,‚Äù ‚Äúisolated‚Äù or ‚Äúpurified‚Äù such that the resulting preparation is substantially free of other components (e.g., free of media components and/or fermentation byproducts). The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of other components‚Äù includes preparations of desired compound in which the compound is separated (e.g., purified or partially purified) from media components or fermentation byproducts of the culture from which it is produced. In one embodiment, the preparation has greater than about 80% (by dry weight) of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 20% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), more preferably greater than about 90% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 10% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), still more preferably greater than about 95% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 5% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), and most preferably greater than about 98-99% desired compound (e.g., less than about 1-2% other media components or fermentation byproducts). When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to a salt, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the salt. When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to an alcohol, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the alcohol. In an alternative embodiment, the desired unsaturated fatty acid is not purified from the plant or microorganism, for example, when the plant or microorganism is biologically non-hazardous (e.g., safe). For example, the entire plant or culture (or culture supernatant) can be used as a source of product (e.g., crude product). In one embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) supernatant is used without modification. In another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is concentrated. In yet another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is pulverized, dried, or lyophilized. B. High Yield Production Methodologies A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention is a high yield production method for producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., DHA, comprising culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that the unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a significantly high yield. The phrase ‚Äúhigh yield production method,‚Äù for example, a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) includes a method that results in production of the desired compound at a level which is elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods. Preferably, a high yield production method results in production of the desired compound at a significantly high yield. The phrase ‚Äúsignificantly high yield‚Äù includes a level of production or yield which is sufficiently elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods, for example, which is elevated to a level sufficient for commercial production of the desired product (e.g., production of the product at a commercially feasible cost). In one embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 2 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 10 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 20 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 40 g/L. The invention further features a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) that involves culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that a sufficiently elevated level of compound is produced within a commercially desirable period of time. In an exemplary embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 15-20 g/L in 36 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 25-30 g/L in 48 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 35-40 g/L in 72 hours, for example, greater that 37 g/L in 72 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30-40 g/L in 60 hours, for example, greater that 30, 35 or 40 g/L in 60 hours. Values and ranges included and/or intermediate within the ranges set forth herein are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention. For example, unsaturated fatty acid production at levels of at least 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 g/L in 60 hours are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. In another example, ranges of 30-35 g/L or 35-40 g/L are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. Moreover, the skilled artisan will appreciate that culturing a manipulated microorganism to achieve a production level of, for example, ‚Äú30-40 g/L in 60 hours‚Äù includes culturing the microorganism for additional time periods (e.g., time periods longer than 60 hours), optionally resulting in even higher yields of an unsaturated fatty acid being produced. IV. Compositions The desaturase nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and fragments thereof, of the invention can be used to produce unsaturated fatty acids which can be incorporated into compositions. Compositions of the present invention include, e.g., compositions for use as animal feed, compositions for use as neutraceuticals (e.g., dietary supplements), and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise an unsaturated fatty acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language ‚Äúpharmaceutically acceptable carrier‚Äù is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL‚Ñ¢ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a LCPUFA, or a fragment thereof, produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with a LCPUFA in the range of between about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody, protein, or polypeptide used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent from the results of diagnostic assays as described herein. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the figures, are incorporated herein by reference. EXAMPLES Materials Thraustochytrium s.p ATCC 21685 and Pythium irregulare were purchased from American type culture collection (12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., 20852 USA) and grown in a medium (Weete, J. D., et al. (1997) Lipids 32:839-845) at 24¬∞ C. for 7 days. After then biomass were harvested by centrifugation and used for RNA isolation. Example 1 Construction and Screening of cDNA Library Total RNA was isolated from the above materials according to Qiu and Erickson (Qiu, X. and Eriekson, L. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. Repr. 12:209-214). The cDNA library was constructed from the total RNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase from Gibco-BRL. The second strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I from Stratagene. After size fractionation, cDNA inserts larger than 1 kb were ligated into Œª Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene). The recombinant DNAs were then packed with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) and plated on NZY plates. The resulting library represented more than 5√ó106 independent clones. Screening of the cDNA library was performed according to standard methods (Sambrook, J, Fritseh, E. F., Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular cloning‚ÄîA laboratory manual . (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA.) Example 2 RT-PCR The single strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) from total RNA and was then used as the template for PCR reaction with two degenerate primers (The forward primer: GCNCA/GANGANCAC/TCCNGGXGG (SEQ ID NO:9) and the reverse primer: ATNTG/TNGGA/GAANAG/AG/ATGG/ATG (SEQ ID NO:10)). The PCR amplification consisted of 35 cycles with 1 min at 94¬∞ C., 1.5 min at 55¬∞ C. and 2 min at 72¬∞ C. followed by an extension step at 72¬∞ C. for 10 min. The amplified products from 800 bp to 1000 bp were isolated from agarose gel and purified by a kit (Qiaex II gel purification, Qiagen), and subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR¬Æ 2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were then sequenced by PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). Example 3 Expression of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 in Yeast The open reading frames of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 were amplified by PCR using the Precision Plus enzyme (Stratagene) and cloned into a TA cloning vector (pCR¬Æ2.1, Invitrogen). Having confirmed that the PCR products were identical to the original cDNAs by sequencing, the fragments were then released by a BarnHI-EcoRI double digestion and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the inducible promoter GAL1. Yeast strains InvSc2 (Invitrogen) was transformed with the expression constructs using the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil (Gietz, D., et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20:1425; Covello, P. S. and Reed, D. W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226). Transformants were first grown in minimal medium lacking uracil and containing glucose at 28¬∞ C. After overnight culture, the cells were spun down, washed and resuspended in distilled water. Minimal medium containing 2% galactose, with or without 0.3 mM substrate fatty acids in the presence of 0.1% tergitol, was inoculated with the yeast transformant cell suspension and incubated at 20¬∞ C. for three days, and then 15¬∞ C. for another three days. Example 4 Fatty Acid Analysis Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare and yeast cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water. Then 2 mL methanolic KOH (7.5% w/v KOH in 95% methanol) was added to the materials and the mixture sealed in a 12 ml glass culture tube was heated to 80¬∞ C. for 2 hours. 0.5 mL water was added and the sample was extracted twice with 2 mL hexane to remove the non-saponifiable lipids. The remaining aqueous phase was then acidified by adding 1 mL 6 N HCl and extracted twice with 2 mL hexane. The hexane phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. 2 mL 3 N methanolic HCl (SUPELCO, Supelco Park, Bellefonte, Pa. 16823-0048) was added and the mixture was heated at 80¬∞ C. for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL 0.9% NaCl was added and the mixture extracted twice with 2√ó2 mL hexane. The combined hexane was evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS according to Covello & Reed (Covello, P. S. and Reed, D. W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226). GC/MS analysis was performed in standard EI mode using a Fisons VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, UK) controlled by Masslynx version 2.0 software, coupled to a GC 8000 Series gas chromatograph. A DB-23 column (30M√ó0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 Œºm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, Calif.) that was temperature-programmed at 180¬∞ C. for 1 min, then 4 C/min to 240¬∞ C. and held for 15 minutes, was used for FAME analysis. Example 5 Transformation of Brassica Juncea and Flax (Linum Usitatissimum) and Exogenous Fatty Acid Treatment The hypocotyls of 5-6 day seedlings of B. juncea and flax were used as explants for inoculation with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens that hosts binary vectors with the full-length cDNAs under the control of the different promoters. The 20-day transgenic seedlings were used for exogenous fatty acid treatment. The seedling was divided into three parts: leaves, stems and roots. Each was cut into the small pieces and placed in a 24-well titer plate. To each well, 2 mL 0.05% sodium salt of substrates (NuCheck Prep Inc., Elysian, Minn.) was added. The plate was then incubated at 24¬∞ C. for 4 h with gentle shaking. After incubation, the plant tissues were washed three times with water and then used for fatty acid analysis. Example 6 Fatty Acid Profile of the Thrauschytrium Sp Thraustochytrium and Pythium irregulare have recently drawn scientific attention due to its ability in production of LCPUFAs such as DHA, AA, EPA and DPA. FIGS. 23 and 24 show the fatty acid composition of the lipids isolated from 7 day cultures of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , respectively. As shown in the tables, the microorganisms contain a broad range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from both n-3 and n-6 families, from 1 8-carbon A6 fatty acids (gamma-linolenic acid and steardonic acid) to 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids (DHA and DPA). The organisms, especially Thraustochytrium sp., appear to contain a full-set of desaturation and elongation enzymes required for the DHA and DPA biosynthesis. The strain lacks 24-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, the proposed precursors for DHA and DPA synthesis in Precher's pathway (Voss, A., et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:19995-20000; Mohammed, B. S., et al. (1997) Biochem. J. 326:425-430). The 24-carbon fatty acid may not be involved in in vivo synthesis of 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids such as DHA and DPA in Thraustochytrium sp. Example 7 Identification of cDNAs Coding for the ‚ÄúFront-End‚Äù Desaturase To identify genes coding for desaturases involved in biosynthesis of LCFUFAs in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , a PCR-based cloning strategy was adopted. Two degenerate primers are designed to target the heme-binding motif of N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in front-end desaturases and the third conservative histidine motif in all microsomal desaturases, respectively. The rational behind the design is that the desaturases involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , should have similar primary structure as other front-end desaturases, i.e. N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in the desaturase. Four cDNAs fragments were identified from Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare that encode fusion proteins containing cyt b5-like domain in the N-terminus. To isolate full-length cDNA clones, the four inserts were used as probes to screen cDNA libraries of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , which resulted in identification of several cDNA clones in each group. Sequencing of all those clones identified four full-length cDNAs which were named as Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2 and Fad6. The open reading frame of Fad4 is 1560 bp and codes for 519 amino acids with molecular weight of 59.1 kDa ( FIGS. 1A and 1B ). Fad5 is 1230 bp in length and codes for 439 amino acids with molecular weight of 49.8 kDa ( FIGS. 2A and 2B ). A sequence comparison of these two sequences from Thraustochytrium sp. showed only 16% amino acid identity between the deduced proteins. A detailed analysis revealed that Fad4 is 80 amino acids longer than Fad5, occurring between the second and third conservative histidine motifs ( FIG. 3 ). The open reading frame of Fad5-2 from Pythium irregulare is 1371 bp and codes for 456 amino acids ( FIGS. 4A and 4B ). Fad6 from Pythium irregulare is 1383 bp in length and codes for 460 amino acids ( FIGS. 5A and 5B ). Sequence comparison of the two sequences from Pythium irregulare showed over 39% similarity between the deduced proteins ( FIG. 6 ). A BLASTP‚Ñ¢ search of the protein database revealed the following hits for each of the four proteins, Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6: Fad 4 (519 amino acid residues)Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF067654MortierellaŒî5 fatty acid50929alpinadesaturaseAF054824MortierellaŒî5 microsomal50928alpinadesaturaseAB022097DictyosteliumŒî5 fatty acid50727discoideumdesaturaseAB029311Dictyosteliumfatty acid51926discoideumdesaturaseL11421Synechocystis sp.Œî6 desaturase41025D90914 Fad 5 (439 amino acid residues)Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF139720Euglena gracilisŒî8 fatty acid40429desaturaseAF007561Borago officinalisŒî6 desaturase42127U79010Borago officinalisŒî6 desaturase42127AF309556Danio rerioŒî6 fatty acid42226desaturaseAF110510MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid46325alpinadesaturase Fad 5-2 (456 amino acid residues)Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAB029311DictosteliumFatty acid44341discoideumdesaturaseAB022097DictosteliumŒî5 fatty acid44539discoideumdesaturaseAF067654MortierellaŒî5 fatty acid44138alpinadesaturaseAF054824MortierellaŒî5 microsomal44138alpinadesaturaseL11421Synechocystis sp.Œî6 desaturase36128D90914 Fad 6 (459 amino acid residues)Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF110510MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43738alpinadesaturaseAB020032MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43738alpinadesaturaseAF306634MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43738isabellinadesaturaseAF307940MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43838alpinadesaturaseAJ250735CeratodonŒî6 fatty acid43836purpureusdesaturase Example 8 Expression of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 in Yeast To confirm the function of Fad4, the full-length cDNA was expressed in the yeast strain InvSc2 under the control of the inducible promoter. FIG. 7 shows that with supplementation of the medium with 22:5 (7, 10, 13, 16, 19), yeast cells containing Fad4 cDNA had an extra fatty acid as compared to the vector control. The peak has a retention time identical to the DHA standard. LC/MS analysis of the free fatty acid showed that it yields deprotonated molecular ions (m/z=279) identical to the DHA standard in negative ion electrospray. Moreover, GC/MS analysis of the FAME confirmed that the spectrum of the peak is identical to that of the DHA standard ( FIGS. 8A and 8B ). These results indicate that Fad4 is a Œî4 fatty acid desaturase which is able to introduce a double bond at position 4 of the 22:5(7, 10, 13, 16, 19) substrate, resulting in a Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DHA (22:6-4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19). To further study the substrate specificity of the Fad4, a number of substrates including 18:2(9, 12), 18:3(9, 12, 15), 20:3(8, 11, 14) and 22:4(7, 10, 13, 16) were separately supplied to the yeast transformants. The results indicated Fad4 could also use 22:4 (7, 10, 13, 16) as a substrate ( FIG. 9 ) to produce another Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DPA (22:5-4, 7, 10, 13, 16) ( FIGS. 10A and 10B ). The rest of the fatty acids examined were not effective substrates. To confirm the function of Fad5 and Fad5-2, the S. cerevisiae Invsc2 was transformed with plasmids, which contain the open reading frame of the Fad5 and Fad5-2 respectively under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter. When the yeast transformants were induced by galactose in a medium containing homo-gamma-linolenic acid (HGLA, 20:3-8, 11, 14), an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 11 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the fatty acid had a retention time identical to the arachidonic acid standard (AA, 20:4-5, 8, 11, 14). To further confirm the regiochemistry of the products, the FAMEs were analyzed by GC/MS. FIGS. 12A and 12B indicate that the mass spectra of the new fatty acid and the AA standard are identical. These results demonstrate that Fad5 and Fad5-2 convert HGLA (20:3-8, 11, 13) into AA (20:4-5, 8, 11, 14) in yeast. To further study the substrate specificity of Fad5-2, the plasmid containing Fad5-2 was transferred into another yeast strain AMY-2a where ole1, a Œî9 desaturase gene, is disrupted. The strain is unable to grow in minimal media without supplementation with mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In this experiment, the strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 17:1(10Z), a non-substrate of Fad5-2, which enabled study of the specificity of the enzyme towards various substrates, especially monounsaturates. A number of possible substrates including 16:1(9Z), 18:1(9Z), 18:1(11Z), 18:1(11E), 18:1(12E), 18:1(15Z), 18:2(9Z,12Z), 18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z), 20:2(11Z,14Z) and 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) were tested. Results indicated that Fad5-2 could desaturate unsaturated fatty acids with Œî9 ethylenic and Œî11 ethylenic double bonds, as well as the fatty acid with Œî8 ethylenic double bond (20:3-8, 11, 14). As shown in FIG. 13 , Fad5-2 effectively converted both 18:1(9Z) and 18:1(11Z) substrates into their corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids, 18:2-5, 9 (the retention time 10.34 min) and 18:1-5, 11 (the retention time 10.44 min), respectively. Fad5-2 also desaturated trans fatty acid such as 18:1(11E) and 18:1(12E). FIG. 25 is a comparison of substrate preference of Fad5-2 for fatty acid substrates tested in the yeast strain AMY-2Œ±. The relative proportions of the substrates and the products accumulated are a useful indicator of substrate preference of the enzyme. As shown in FIG. 25 , Fad5-2 prefers fatty acids with 20-carbon as substrates, such as 20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z), 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) and 20:2(11Z,14Z). Whereas, the shorter chain fatty acid is a relatively weaker substrate for the enzyme in yeast. To confirm the function of Fad6, the S. cerevisiae host strain Invsc2 was transformed with a plasmid containing the open reading frame of Fad6 under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter, GAL1. When the yeast transformant was induced by galactose in a medium containing linoleic acid, an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of the FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 14 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the peak had a retention time identical to the gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3-6, 9, 12) standard. To confirm the regioselectivity of the products, the diethylamine derivatives of fatty acids from the expressing strain were analyzed by GC-MS. FIG. 15 shows that the new peak is indeed GLA with three double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions. Major fragments of n and n+1 carbons differing by 12 D are diagnostic of a double bond between carbon n+1 and n+2. Thus, the fragments at 156 and 168, 196 and 208, and 236 and 248, indicate double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions, respectively. These results demonstrate that Fad6 is a Œî6 desaturase that converts linoleic acid (18:2) to GLA in yeast. Example 9 Expression of Fad4 in B. Juncea To determine whether Traustochytrium Fad4 is functional in oilseed crops, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad4 under the control of a constitutive promoter. Eight independent transgenic plants were obtained. In B. juncea there is no Œî4 fatty acid desaturase substrates available. Thus, to examine the activity of the transgenic enzyme in the plants, the 22:5 (n-3) substrate must be exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium docosapentaeneate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of both types of plants, but converted into DHA only in transgenics. Leaves have a higher level of production of DHA than roots and stems. In leaves, the exogenous substrate was incorporated to a level of 10-20% of the total fatty acids and Œî4 desaturated fatty acid (22:6, n-3) was produced in a range of 3-6% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 16 ). These results indicate that the Œî4 fatty acid desaturase from Traustochytrium is functional in oilseed crops. Example 10 Expression of Fad5-2 in B. Juncea To determine whether Fad5-2 is functional in oilseed crops and its expression has any effect on their growth and development, B. juncea were transformed with a binary vector that contained Fad5-2 cDNA behind a constitutive promoter (a tandem cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter). Six independent primary transgenic plants were obtained and the fatty acid profile of lipids from different tissues was determined. FIG. 17 shows the fatty acid composition of three-week-old seedling plants from one T 1 line. Compared with wild type, all transgenic plant tissues have an altered fatty acid profile containing four additional peaks which were identified as four different Œî5-undesaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids (Œî5-UPIFAs), specifically, taxoleic (18:2-5,9); ephedrenic (18:2-5,11); pinolenic (18:3-5, 9, 12), and coniferonic acids (18:4-5, 9, 12, 15). Thus B. juncea , like yeast, can functionally express the P. irregulare Œî 5 desaturase to convert the endogenous substrates 18:1-9; 18:1-11; 18:2-9, 12, and 18:3-9, 12, 15 to the corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids. The roots produced the highest amount of the Œî5-UPIFAs, representing more than 20% of the total fatty acids, followed by 6% in stems and 5% in leaves ( FIG. 17 ). In B. juncea there is no homo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3-8, 11, 14) substrate available. Thus, to examine whether the transgenic plant can produce AA, the substrate 20:3(8, 11, 14) was exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium homo-gamma-linolenate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of transgenic plants and converted into AA in plants ( FIG. 18 ). There was no observable phenotypic effect on the growth and development in the transgenic B. juncea , although the Œî5-UPIFAs accumulated in all parts of the plant. Growth and differentiation of vegetative tissues such as the leaves, stems, and roots were indistinguishable from the corresponding wild type. To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in seeds, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad5-2 cDNA behind a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Fatty acid analysis of transgenic seeds showed that there were two new fatty acids appearing in the gas chromatogram of transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 19 ). They were identified as taxoleic acid (18:2-5, 9) and pinolenic acids (18:3-5, 9, 12). Together, these fatty acids represent 9.4% of the seed fatty acids. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs has no significant effect on the oleic acid content compared with the untransformed control. Example 11 Expression of Fad5-2 in Flax To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, flax was transformed with Fad5-2 under the control of two seed-specific promoters, a heterologous B. napus napin promoter, and a flax endogenous promoter. As shown in FIG. 26 , transgenic plants containing the napin promoter produced one Œî5 desaturated fatty acid, taxoleic acid in seeds at the level of less than 1% of the total fatty acids. Whereas transgenic plants containing the flax seed-specific promoter produced three Œî5 desaturated fatty acids: taxoleic, pinolenic, and coniferonic acid. Of these, taxoleic (18:2-5, 9) was the most abundant and accounted for more than 9% of the total fatty acids in a elite line (FN-10-1), followed by coniferonic and pinolenic acids. Surprisingly, accumulation of Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in transgenic seeds has significant impact on the composition of other fatty acids, especially the oleic acid level. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs was accompanied by a huge increase of the oleic acids in both types of transgenic plants expressing Fad5-2 desaturase under the control of the different promoters. The content of oleic acid in transgenic plants with the napin and flax seed-specific promoters, on the average, reached 44.7% and 24.3% of the total fatty acids, respectively, relative to the untransformed control at 17.4%. Example 12 Expression of Fad6 in Flax To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, two types of flax were transformed with the construct that contains Fad6 cDNA under the control of a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Type I flax (Normandy) is a traditional industrial oilseed crop, whereas Type II (Solin) is an edible oilseed crop derived from chemical mutagenesis of Type I. A total of twelve transgenic plants were produced. The majority of transgenics exhibited two novel fatty acids whose retention times correspond to GLA and SDA and they constitute 0.1 to 4.3% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 27 ). The level of GLA in transgenic Solin type is higher than that of SDA, while GLA in transgenic Normandy is lower than SDA. This is understandable because linoleic acid is a major fatty acid in Solin type linseed while Œ±-linolenic acid is a major fatty acid in Normandy seeds. Example 13 Expression of Fad6 in B. Juncea To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in seeds of B. juncea, B. juncea were transformed with the same construct used in flax transformation, i.e., Fad6 under the control of the B. napus napin promoter. Fifteen independent transgenic plants were obtained. Fatty acid analysis of the transgenic seeds showed that there were three new fatty acids in the gas chromatogram of most transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 20 ). The three fatty acids were identified as 18:2(6, 9) and 18:3(6, 9, 12), and 18:4(6, 9, 12, 15). B. juncea , like flax, can also functionally express Fad6 from P. irregulare , introducing a double bond at position 6 of endogenous substrate 18:1(9), 18:2(9, 12), and 18:3(6, 9, 12) resulting in production of three corresponding Œî6 fatty acids in the transgenic seeds. Among the three new fatty acids produced in transgenic seeds, GLA is the most abundant one, with a level in transgenic seeds of 30% to 38% of the total fatty acids. The next most abundant component is SDA, which accounts for 3-10% of the total fatty acids in several transgenic lines ( FIG. 21 ). The fatty acid compositions of transgenic seeds are shown in FIG. 22 . It is clear that the high level production of Œî6 desaturated fatty acids is at the cost of two major fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acids. Proportions of oleic and stearic acids in transgenics are slightly reduced, but not significantly compared to those in the wild type control. The content of linoleic acid in the transgenics was dramatically reduced. In the untransformed wild type, linoleic acid accounts for more than 40% of the total fatty acids in seeds. In transgenics, the level was reduced to less than 10%. As compared to the reduction of linoleic acid in transgenics, the decrease in linolenic acid in transgenics is less dramatic, but still significant. In the untransformed wild type, linolenic acid accounts for more than 10% of the total fatty acids in seeds while in transgenics the level was reduced to less than 5%. The two dramatically reduced fatty acids in transgenic seeds are the substrates of the Œî6 desaturase, and the reduction is the cost for producing two corresponding Œî6 desaturated fatty acids.

in many biological processes. Fatty acids are rarely free in nature but, rather, occur in esterified form as the major component of lipids. Lipids/fatty acids are sources of energy (e.g., b-cxidation) and are an integral part of cell membranes which are indispensable for processing biological or biochemical information. Fatty acids can be divided into two groups: the saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids which contain one or more carbon double bond in  cis- configuration. Unsaturated fatty acids are produced by terminal desaturases that belong to the class of nonheme-iron enzymes. Each of these enzymes are part of a electron-transport system that contains two other proteins, namely cytochrome b 5  and NADH-cytochrome b 5  reductase. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. Human and other mammals have a limited spectrum of these desaturase that are required for the formation of particular double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, humans have to take up some fatty acids through their diet. Such essential fatty acids, for example, are linoleic acid (C18:2); linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4). In contrast, insects and plants are able to synthesize a much larger variety of unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)) are essential components of cell membranes of various tissues-and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). For example, over 30% of fatty acids in brain phospholipid are 22:6 (n-3) and 20:4 (n-6). ( Crawford, M.A., et al., (1997) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66:1032S-1041S ). In retina, DHA accounts for more than 60% of the total fatty acids in the rod outer segment, the photosensitive part of the photoreceptor cell. ( Giusto, N.M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391 ). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults ( Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138 ). DHA also has significant effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development ( Giusto, N.M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391 ). In addition, some positive effects of DHA were also found on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers ( Horrocks, L.A. and Yeo, Y.K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215 ). Therefore, the appropriate dietary supply of the fatty acid is important for humans to remain healthy. It is particularly important for infant, young children and senior citizens to adequately intake these fatty acids from the diet since they cannot be efficiently synthesized in their body and must be supplemented by food ( Spector, A.A. (1999) Lipids 34:S1-S3 ). DHA is a fatty acid of the n-3 series according to the location of the last double bond in the methyl end. It is synthesized via alternating steps of desaturation and elongation. Starting with 18:3 (9,12,15), biosynthesis of DHA involves Œî6 desaturation to 18:4 (6,9,12,15), followed by elongation to 20:4 (8,11,14,17) and Œî5 desaturation to 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17). Beyond this point, there are some controversies about the biosynthesis. The conventional view is that 20:5 (5,8;11,14,17) is elongated to 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19) and then converted to 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19) by the final Œî4 desaturation ( Horrobin, D.F. (1992) Prog. Lipid Res. 31:163-194 ). However, Sprecher et al. recently suggested an alternative pathway for DHA biosynthesis, which is independent of Œî4 desaturase, involving two consecutive elongations, a Œî6 desaturation and a two-carbon shortening via limited Œ≤-oxidation in peroxisome ( Sprecher, H., et al. (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36:2471-2477 ;  Sprecher, H., et al. (1999) Lipids 34:S153-S156 ). Production of DHA is important because of its beneficial effect on human health. Currently the major sources of DHA are oils from fish and algae. Fish oil is a major and traditional source for this fatty acid, however, it is usually oxidized by the time it is sold. In addition, the supply of the oil is highly variable and its source is in jeopardy with the shrinking fish populations while the algal source is expensive due to low yield and the high costs of extraction. EPA and AA are both Œî5 essential fatty acids. They form a unique class of food and feed constituents for humans and animals. EPA belongs to the n-3 series with five double bonds in the acyl chain, is found in marine food, and is abundant in oily fish from North Atlantic. AA belongs to the n-6 series with four double bonds. The lack of a double bond in the œâ-3 position confers on AA different properties than those ' found in EPA. The eicosanoids produced from AA have strong inflammatory and platelet aggregating properties, whereas those derived from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet aggregating properties. AA can be obtained from some foods such as meat, fish, and eggs, but the concentration is low. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is another essential fatty acid found in mammals. GLA is the metabolic intermediate for very long chain n-6 fatty acids and for various active molecules. In mammals, formation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is rate-limited by Œî6 desaturation. Many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, stress, diabetes, eczema, and some infections have been shown to depress the Œî6 desaturation step. In addition; GLA is readily catabolized from the oxidation and rapid cell division associated with certain disorders, e.g., cancer or inflammation. Therefore, dietary supplementation with GLA can reduce the risks of these disorders. Clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation with GLA is effective in treating some pathological conditions such as atopic eczema, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders. The predominant sources of GLA are oils from plants such as evening primrose ( Oenothera biennis ), borage ( Borago officinalis  L.), black currant ( Ribes nigrum ), and from microorganisms such as  Mortierella sp., Mucor sp.,  and  Cyanobacteria.  However, these GLA sources are not ideal for dietary supplementation due to large fluctuations in availability and costs associated with extraction processes. Genes encoding desaturases, including delta5 desaturases, have been cloned from  Thraustochytrium  sp. ( Qiu X. et al., J.Biol.Chem. 276 (2001), N¬∞.34, pp.31561-31566 ) and other organisms (see for instance  WO98/46765 ,  WO98/46764 ,  WO00/20602 ,  WO00/20603  and  WO99/33958 ). Summary of the Invention The biosynthesis of fatty acids is a major activity of plants and microorganisms. However, humans have a limited capacity for synthesizing essential fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Biotechnology has long been considered an efficient way to manipulate the process of producing fatty acids in plants and microorganisms. It is cost-effective and renewable with little side effects. Thus; tremendous industrial effort directed to the production of various compounds including speciality fatty acids and pharmaceutical polypeptides through the manipulation of plant, animal, and microorganismal cells has ensued. Accordingly, biotechnology is an attractive route for producing unsaturated fatty acids, especially LCPUFAs, in a safe, cost-efficient manner so as to garner the maximum therapeutic value from these fatty acids. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a family of nucleic acid molecules encoding novel desaturases. In particular, the present inventors have identified the Fad5-2 (Œî5 desaturase), which is involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6, n-3) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5, n-6); more specifically, Fad5-2 desaturate 20:4 (n-3) and 20:3(n-6) resulting in EPA and AA.

The most common naturally occurring fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids which have an even number of carbon atoms (16 or 18) and which may be saturated or unsaturated. \\\"Unsaturated\\\" fatty acids contain  cis  double bonds between the carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids encompassed by the present invention include, for example, DHA, GLA, and SDA. \\\"Polyunsaturated\\\" fatty acids contain more than one double bond and the double bonds are arranged in a methylene interrupted system (-CH=CH-CH 2 -CH=CH-). Fatty acids are described herein by a numbering system in which the number before the colon indicates the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, whereas the number after the colon is the number of double bonds that are present. In the case of unsaturated fatty acids, this is followed by a number in parentheses that indicates the position of the double bonds. Each number in parenthesis is the lower numbered carbon atom of the two connected by the double bond. For example; oleic acid can be described as 18:1(9) and linoleic acid can be described as 18:2(9, 12) indicating 18 carbons, one double bond at carbon 9, two double bonds at carbons 9 and 12, respectively. The controlling steps in the production of unsaturated fatty acids, i.e., the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, are catalyzed by membrane-associated fatty acid desaturases,  e.g ., Fad5-2. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. As used herein, the term \\\"unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway\\\" refers to a series of chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of an unsaturated fatty acid either  in vivo  or  in vitro.  Such a pathway includes a series of desaturation and elongation steps which generate unsaturated fatty acids and ultimately, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Such unsaturated fatty acids can include, GLA 18:3 (6,9,12), SDA 18:4 (6,9,12,15), AA 20:4 (5,8,11,14), EPA 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17), and DPA 22:5 (4,7,10,13,16), and DHA 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19). Desaturases can contain a heme-binding motif and/or about three conservative histidine motifs, although additional domains may be present. Members of the fatty acid desaturase family convert saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids,  e.g ., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), which are components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). Examples of LCPUFA include, among others, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA., 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults ( Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S1 38 ). DHA also has effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development ( Giusto, N.M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391 ). In addition, positive effects of DHA were also found in the treatment of diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers ( Horrocks, L.A. and Yeo, Y.K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215 ). Thus, the desaturase molecules can be used to produce the LCPUFAs useful in treating disorders characterized by aberrantly regulated growth, proliferation, or differentiation. Such disorders include cancer,  e.g ., carcinoma; sarcoma, or leukemia; tumor angiogenesis and metastasis; skeletal dysplasia; hepatic disorders; myelodysplastic syndromes; and hematopoietic and/or myeloproliferative disorders.. Other disorders related to angiogenesis and which are, therefore, desaturase associated disorders include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. The term \\\"family\\\" when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention is intended to mean two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin or alternatively, can contain homologues of non-human origin,  e.g ., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. For example, the family of desaturase proteins of the present invention comprises one cytochrome b5 heme-binding motif. As used herein, the term \\\"heme-binding motif\\\" is an N-terminal extension of the cytochrome b5-like domain found in front-end desaturases. In another embodiment, members of the desaturase family of proteins include a \\\"histidine motifs\\\" in the protein, preferably, about three or four histidine motifs. As used herein, the term \\\"histidine motif\\\" includes a protein domain having at least about two histidine amino acid residues, preferably about three or four histidine amino acid residues, and is typically found in all microsomal desaturases as the third conservative histidine motif. Examples of cytochrome b5 heme-binding motifs and histidine motifs include amino acid residues 40-45; 171-176, 208-213, and 395-400 of SEQ ID NO:6, as shown in  Figure 3 . Isolated desaturase proteins of the present invention have an amino acid sequence sufficiently homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 or are encoded by a nucleotide sequence sufficiently homologous to SEQ ID NO: 5. Proteins of the invention are described in claim 11. As used herein, the term \\\"sufficiently homologous\\\" refers to a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence which contains a sufficient or minimum number of identical or equivalent ( e.g ., an amino acid residue which has a similar side chain) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleotide sequences share common structural domains or motifs and/or a common functional activity. For example, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share common structural domains having at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%. 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity across the amino acid sequences of the domains and contain at least one and preferably two structural domains or motifs, are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. Furthermore, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity and share a common functional activity are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains or motifs: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif and has an amino acid sequence at least about 98%, 99% or more homologous or identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif, and is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5. In another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one heme-binding motif and/or at least about three histidine motifs, and has a desaturase activity. As used interchangeably herein, a \\\"desaturase activity,\\\" \\\"biological activity of a desaturase,\\\" or \\\"functional activity of a desaturase,\\\" includes an activity exerted or mediated by a desaturase protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on a desaturase responsive cell or on a desaturase substrate, as determined in vivo or in vitro, according to standard techniques. In one embodiment, a desaturase activity is a direct activity such as an association with a desaturase target molecule. As used herein, a \\\"target molecule\\\" or \\\"binding partner\\\" is a molecule e.g., a molecule involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, with which a desaturase protein binds or interacts in nature such that a desaturase-mediated function is achieved. A desaturase direct activity also includes the formation of a double bond between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule to form an unsaturated fatty acid molecule. The nucleotide sequence of the  Pythium irregulare  Œî5 desaturase, Fad5-2, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5-2 cDNA are shown in  Figure 1  and in SEQ ID NOs:5 and 6, respectively. The  Pythium irregulare  Fad5-2 gene, which is approximately 1371 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 456 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the  Pythium irregulare  Œî6 desaturase, Fad6, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad6 cDNA are shown in  Figure 2  and in SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8, respectively. The  Pythium irregulare  Fad6 gene, which is approximately 1383 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 460 amino acid residues in length. Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections: I. Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode desaturase proteins. Described herein are nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify desaturase-encoding nucleic acid molecules ( e.g ., desaturase mRNA) and fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of desaturase nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term \\\"nucleic acid molecule\\\" is intended to include DNA molecules ( e.g.,  cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules ( e.g ., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. The term \\\"isolated nucleic acid molecule\\\" includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term \\\"isolated\\\" includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an \\\"isolated\\\" nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid ( i.e ., sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated desaturase nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4kb, 3kb, 2kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an \\\"isolated\\\" nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention,  e.g ., a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information provided herein. Using all or a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, as hybridization probes, desaturase nucleic acid molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques ( e.g ., as described in  Sambrook, J. et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989 ). Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule encompassing all or a portion of SEQ ID NO: 5, can be isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed based upon the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5. A nucleic acid of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to desaturase nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques,  e.g ., using an automated DNA synthesizer. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule consists of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 5. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5, is one which is sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5, such that it can hybridize to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5, thereby forming a stable duplex. Nucleic acid molecules which comprise only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, for example, a fragment, can be used as a probe or primer. The nucleotide sequence determined from the cloning of the desaturase gene allows for the generation of probes and primers designed for use in identifying and/or cloning other desaturase family members, as well as desaturase homologues from other species. The probe/primer ( e.g ., oligonucleotide) typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 12 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 75 consecutive nucleotides of a sense sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, of an anti-sense sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, or of a naturally occurring allelic variant or mutant of SEQ ID NO: 5. Exemplary probes or primers are at least (or no greater than) 12 or 15, 20 or 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or more nucleotides in length and/or comprise consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein. Also described are probes or primers comprising contiguous or consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein, but for the difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases within the probe or primer sequence. Probes based on the desaturase nucleotide sequences can be used to detect ( e.g ., specifically detect) transcripts or genomic sequences encoding the same or homologous proteins. The probe may further comprise a label group attached thereto,  e.g ., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. Also described is a set of primers ,  e.g ., primers suitable for use in a PCR, which can be used to amplify a selected region of a desaturase sequence,  e.g ., a domain, region, site or other sequence described herein. The primers should be at least 5, 10, or 50 base pairs in length and less than 100, or less than 200, base pairs in length. The primers should be identical, or differ by no greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases when compared to a sequence disclosed herein or to the sequence of a naturally occurring variant. Such probes can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissue which misexpress a desaturase protein, such as by measuring a level of a desaturase-encoding nucleic acid in a sample of cells from a subject,  e.g ., detecting desaturase mRNA levels or determining whether a genomic desaturase gene has been mutated or deleted. A nucleic acid fragment encoding a \\\"biologically active portion of a desaturase protein\\\" can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, which encodes a polypeptide having a desaturase biological activity (the biological activities of the desaturase proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the desaturase protein ( e.g ., by recombinant expression  in vitro ) and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the desaturase protein. The nucleic acid molecule may be at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and encodes a protein having a desaturase activity (as described herein). The invention further encompasses nucleic acid.molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same desaturase proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 5. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs by at least 1, but no greater than 5 amino acid residues from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6. If an alignment is needed for this comparison, the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. Nucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologues (different locus), and orthologues (different organism) or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product). Allelic variants result, for example, from DNA sequence polymorphisms within a population ( e.g ., the human population) that lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the desaturase proteins. Such genetic polymorphism in the desaturase genes may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. As used herein, the terms \\\"gene\\\" and \\\"recombinant gene\\\" refer to nucleic acid molecules which include an open reading frame encoding a desaturase protein, e.g., oilseed desaturase protein, and can further include non-coding regulatory sequences, and introns. Described herein are, isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a naturally occurring allelic variant of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6, wherein the nucleic acid molecule hybridizes to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 5 , for example, under stringent hybridization conditions. Allelic variants of desaturase,  e.g ., Fad5-2, include both functional and non-functional desaturase proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein that maintain the ability to,  e.g.,  (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule ( e.g ., a fatty acid,  e.g ., DHA); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. The fatty acids produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention are also useful in treating disorders such as aging, stress, diabetes, cancer, inflammatory disorders (e.g., arthritis, eczema), and cardiovascular disorders. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only a conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 6, or a substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Non-functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein,  e.g ., Fad5-2, that do not have the ability to,  e.g ., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecules ( e.g ., an intermediate fatty acid, such as 18:4 (6,9,12,15)); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitutions, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID :NO: 6 , or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. The present invention further describes orthologues ( e.g. , human orthologues of the desaturase proteins). Orthologues of the  Pythium irregulare  desaturase proteins are proteins that are isolated from other organisms and possess the same desaturase substrate or target molecule binding mechanisms, double bond forming mechanisms, modulating mechanisms of growth and development of the brain in infants, maintenance mechanisms of normal brain function in adults, ability to affect photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, ability to affect rhodopsin activation, development mechanisms of rods and/or cones, and/or modulating mechanisms of cellular growth and/or proliferation of the non-human desaturase proteins. Orthologues of the  Pythium irregulare  desaturase proteins can readily be identified as comprising an amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to SEQ ID NO: 6. Described herein are nucleic acid molecules encoding other desaturase family members and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 5. For example, another desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of Fad5-2. Described herein are nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins from different species which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 5. For example,  Schizochytrium  or  Crythecodinium  desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of a Fad5-2. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the desaturase cDNAs of the invention can be isolated based on their homology to the desaturase nucleic acids disclosed herein using the cDNAs disclosed herein, or a portion thereof, as a hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent hybridization conditions. Orthologues, homologues and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art ( e.g. , by hybridization to an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions). Described herein is an isolated nucleic acid molecule which is at least 15, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5. Also described is a nucleic acid which is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700; 750-1000, 1000-1250,1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length. As used herein, the term \\\"hybridizes under stringent conditions\\\" is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences that are significantly identical or homologous to each other remain hybridized to each other. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% identical to each other remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in  Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1995 ), sections 2, 4, and 6. Additional stringent conditions can be found in  Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY (1989), chapters 7, 9, and 11 . A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4X sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70¬∞C (or alternatively hybridization in 4X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞C) followed by one or more washes in 1X SSC, at about 65-70¬∞C. A preferred, non-limiting example of highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 1X SSC, at about 65-70¬∞C (or alternatively hybridization in 1X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞C) followed by one or more washes in 0.3X SSC, at about 65-70¬∞C. A preferred, non-limiting example of reduced stringency hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4X SSC, at about 50-60¬∞C (or alternatively hybridization in 6X SSC plus 50% formamide at about 40-45¬∞C) followed by one or more washes in 2X SSC, at about 50-60¬∞C. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values,  e.g ., at 65-70¬∞C or at 42-50¬∞C are also intended to be encompassed by the present invention. SSPE (1xSSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 1.25mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1X SSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-10¬∞C less than the melting temperature (T m ) of the hybrid, where T m  is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞C) = 2(# of A + T bases) + 4(# of G + C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞C) = 81.5 + 16.6(log 10 [Na + ]) + 0.41 (%G+C) - (600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na + ] is the concentration of sodium ions in The hybridization buffer ([Na + ] for 1X SSC =0.165 M). It will also be recognized by the skilled practitioner that additional reagents may be added to hybridization and/or wash buffers to decrease non-specific hybridization of nucleic acid molecu*les to membranes, for example, nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, including but not limited to blocking agents ( e.g. , BSA or salmon or herring sperm carrier DNA), detergents ( e.g. , SDS), chelating agents ( e.g ., EDTA), Ficoll, PVP and the like. When using nylon membranes, in particular, an additional preferred; non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 0.25-0.5M NaH 2 PO 4 , 7% SDS at about 65¬∞C, followed by one or more washes at 0.02M NaH 2 PO 4 , 1% SDS at 65¬∞C (see  e.g .,  Church and Gilbert (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1991-1995 ), or alternatively 0.2X SSC, 1% SDS. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a \\\"naturally-occurring\\\" nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature ( e.g ., encodes a natural protein). In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of the desaturase sequences that may exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by mutation into the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: 5, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded desaturase proteins, without altering the functional ability of the desaturase proteins. For example, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at \\\"non-essential\\\" amino acid residues can be made in the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5. A \\\"non-essential\\\" amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of Fad5-2 ( e.g ., the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 ) without altering the biological activity, whereas an \\\"essential\\\" amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the desaturase proteins of the present invention,  e.g ., those present in a heme-binding motif or a histidine motif, are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. Furthermore, additional amino acid residues that are conserved between the desaturase proteins of the present invention and other members of the fatty acid desaturase family are not likely to be amenable to alteration. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such desaturase proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO: 6, or 8, yet retain biological activity. In one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, wherein the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 98% 99% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO: 6,  e.g ., to the entire length of SEQ ID NO: 6. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a desaturase protein homologous to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 6 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into SEQ ID NO: 5 by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A \\\"conservative amino acid substitution\\\" is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains ( e.g ., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains ( e.g ., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains ( e.g ., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains ( e.g. , alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains ( e.g. , threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains ( e.g. , tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a desaturase protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a desaturase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for desaturase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO: 5, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. A mutant desaturase protein can be assayed for the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule ( e.g. , an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. II: Isolated Desaturase Proteins One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated or recombinant desaturase proteins and polypeptides. In one embodiment, native desaturase proteins can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, desaturase proteins are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a desaturase protein or polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. An \\\"isolated\\\" or \\\"purified\\\" protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the desaturase protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language \\\"substantially free of cellular material\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolate or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language \\\"substantially free of cellular material\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, or 30% (by dry weight) of non-desaturase protein (also referred to herein as a \\\"contaminating protein\\\"), more preferably less than about 20% of non-desaturase protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-desaturase protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-desaturase protein. When the desaturase protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. The language \\\"substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language \\\"substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals\\\" includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-desalurase chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals. It should be understood that the proteins or this invention can also be in a form which is different than their corresponding naturally occurring proteins and/or which is still in association with at least some cellular components. For example, the protein can be associated with a cellular membrane. As used herein, a \\\"biologically active portion\\\" of a desaturase protein includes a fragment of a desaturase protein which participates in an interaction between a desaturase molecule and a non-desaturase molecule ( e.g. , a desaturase substrate such as fatty acid). Biologically active portions of a desaturase protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the desaturase amino acid sequences,  e.g. , the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO: 6 which include sufficient amino acid residues to exhibit at least one activity of a desaturase protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the desaturase protein; the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule ( e.g. , an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. A biologically active portion of a desaturase protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200 or more amino acids in length. A biologically active portion of a desaturase protein comprises a heme-binding motif and/or at least one histidine motifs, preferably about three histidine motifs. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native desaturase protein. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 6. In other embodiments, the desaturase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO: 6 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO: 6, yet differs in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. In another embodiment, the desaturase protein is a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence at least 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NO: 6. In another embodiment, the invention features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, or a complement thereof. Also described herein is a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5, or a complement thereof. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes ( e.g. , gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). The length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the length of the preference sequence ( e.g. , when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5-2 amino acid sequence ofSEQ ID NO:6 having 456 amino acid residues, at least 137, preferably at least 182, more preferably at least 228, even more preferably at least 273, and even more preferably at least 319, 365, or 419 amino acid residues are aligned . The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid \\\"identity\\\" is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid \\\"homology\\\"). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the  Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol. (48):444-453 (1970 )) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at  http://www.gcg.com ), using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix; and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at  http://www.gcg.com) , using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A preferred, non-limiting example of parameters to be used in conjunction with the GAP program include a Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of  Meyers and Miller (Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:11-17 (1988 )) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0 or version 2.0U), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a \\\"query sequence\\\" to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of  Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10 . BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score = 100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to desaturase nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score =50, wordlength = 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to desaturase protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in  Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402 . When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs ( e.g. , XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. III. Methods of Producing Unsaturated Fatty Acids The present invention provides new and improved methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids,  e.g. , LCPUFAs, such as, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 (n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 (n-6)), AA (Arachidonic acid, 20:4 (n-6)) and EPA (eicosapentaenioc acid, 20:5(n-3)). A.  Recombinant Cells and Methods for Culturing Cells The present invention further features recombinant vectors that include nuclei acid sequences that encode the gene products as described herein, preferably Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 gene products. The term recombinant vector includes a vector ( e.g. , plasmid) that has been altered, modified or engineered such that it contains greater, fewer or different nucleic acid sequences than those included in the native vector or plasmid. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector includes the nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one fatty acid desaturase enzyme operably linked to regulatory sequences. The phrase \\\"operably linked to regulatory sequence(s)\\\" means that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression ( e.g. , enhanced, increased, constitutive, basal, attenuated, decreased or repressed expression) of the nucleotide sequence, preferably expression of a gene product encoded by the nucleotide sequence ( e.g. , when the recombinant vector is introduced into a cell). Exemplary vectors are described in further detail herein as well as in, for example,  Frascotti et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,137 The term \\\"regulatory sequencer\\\" includes nucleic acid sequences which affect ( e.g. , modulate or regulate) expression of other (non-regulatory) nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, a regulator sequence is included in a recombinant vector in a similar or identical position and/or orientation relative to a particular gene of interest as is observed for the regulatory sequence and gene of interest as it appears in nature,  e.g. , in a native position and/or orientation. For example, a gene of interest ( e.g. , a Fad5-2 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to the gene in the natural organism ( e.g. , operably linked to \\\"native\\\" Fad5-2 regulatory sequence ( e.g. , to the \\\"native\\\" Fad5-2 promoter). Alternatively, a gene of interest ( e.g. , a Fad5-2 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to another ( e.g. , a different) gene in the natural organism. For example, a Fad5-2 gene can be included in a vector operably linked to non-Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequences. Alternatively, a gene of interest ( e.g. , a Fad5-2 gene) can be included in a vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence from another organism. For example, regulatory sequences from other microbes ( e.g. , other bacterial regulatory sequences, bacteriophage regulatory sequences and the like) can be operably linked to a particular gene of interest. Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers, termination signals and other expression control elements ( e.g. , binding sites for transcriptional and/or translational regulatory proteins, for example, in the transcribed mRNA). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in  Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989 . Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell ( e.g. , constitutive promoters and strong constitutive promoters), those which direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell ( e.g. , inducible promoters, for example, xylose inducible promoters) and those which attenuate or repress expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell ( e.g. , attenuation signals or repressor sequences). It is also within the scope of the present invention to regulate expression of a gene of interest by removing or deleting regulatory sequences. For example, sequences involved in the negative regulation of transcription can be removed such that expression of a gene of interest is enhanced. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes nucleic acid sequences that encode at least one gene product ( e.g. , Fad5-2) operably linked to a promoter or promoter sequence. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes a terminator sequence or terminator sequences ( e.g. , transcription terminator sequences). The term terminator sequences\\\" includes regulatory sequences which serve to terminate transcription of mRNA. Terminator sequences (or tandem transcription terminators) can further serve to stabilize mRNA ( e.g. , by adding structure to mRNA), for example, against nucleases. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes antibiotic resistance sequences. The term \\\"antibiotic resistance sequences\\\" includes sequences which promote or confer resistance to antibiotics on the host organism. In one embodiment, the antibiotic resistance sequences are selected from the group consisting of  cat  (chloramphenicol resistance),  tet  (tetracycline resistance) sequences, erm (erythromycin resistance) sequences, neo (neomycin resistance) sequences and  spec  (spectinomycin resistance) sequences. Recombinant vectors of the present invention can further include homologous recombination sequences ( e.g. , sequences designed to allow recombination of the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host organism). For example,  amyE  sequences can be used as homology targets for recombination into the host chromosome. The term \\\"manipulated cell\\\" includes a cell that has been engineered ( e.g. , genetically engineered) or modified such that the cell has at least one fatty acid desaturase,  e.g. , Fad5-2, such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced. Modification or engineering of such microorganisms can be according to any methodology described herein including, but not limited to, deregulation of a biosynthetic pathway and/or overexpression of at least one biosynthetic enzyme. A \\\"manipulated\\\" enzyme ( e.g. , a \\\"manipulated\\\" biosynthetic enzyme) includes an enzyme, the expression or production of which has been altered or modified such that at least one upstream or downstream precursor, substrate or product of the enzyme is altered or modified, for example, as compared to a corresponding wild-type or naturally occurring enzyme. The term \\\"overexpressed\\\" or \\\"overexpression\\\" includes expression of a gene product ( e.g. , a fatty acid desaturase) at a level greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. In one embodiment, the cell can be genetically manipulated ( e.g. , genetically engineered) to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. Genetic manipulation can include, but is not limited to, altering or modifying regulatory sequences or sites associated with expression of a particular gene ( e.g. , by adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or by removing regulatory sequences such that expression is constitutive), modifying the chromosomal location of a particular gene, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to a particular gene such as a ribosome binding site or transcription terminator, increasing the copy number of a particular gene, modifying proteins ( e.g. , regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of a particular gene routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). In another embodiment, the cell can be physically or environmentally manipulated to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. For example, a cell can be treated with or cultured in the presence of an agent known or suspected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. Alternatively, a cell can be cultured at a temperature selected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. The term \\\"deregulated\\\" or \\\"deregulation\\\" includes the alteration or modification of at least one gene in a cell that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway, such that the level or activity of the biosynthetic enzyme in the cell is altered or modified. Preferably, at least one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the gene product is enhanced or increased. The phrase \\\"deregulated pathway\\\" can also include a biosynthetic pathway in which more than one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the level or activity of more than one biosynthetic enzyme is altered or modified. The ability to \\\"deregulate\\\" a pathway ( e.g. , to simultaneously deregulate more than one gene in a given biosynthetic pathway) in a cell arises from the particular phenomenon of cells in which more than one enzyme ( e.g. , two or three biosynthetic enzymes) are encoded by genes occurring adjacent to one another on a contiguous piece of genetic material termed an \\\"operon\\\". The term \\\"operon\\\" includes a coordinated unit of gene expression that contains a promoter and possibly a regulatory element associated with one or more, preferably at least two, structural genes ( e.g. , genes encoding enzymes, for example, biosynthetic enzymes). Expression of the structural genes can be coordinately regulated, for example, by regulatory proteins binding to the regulatory element or by anti-termination of transcription. The structural genes can be transcribed to give a single mRNA that encodes all of the structural proteins. Due to the coordinated regulation of genes included in an operon, alteration or modification of the single promoter and/or regulatory element can result in alteration or modification of each gene product encoded by the operon. Alteration or modification of the regulatory element can include, but is not limited to removing the endogenous promoter and/or regulatory element(s), adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or removing regulatory sequences such that expression of the gene products is modified, modifying the chromosomal location of the operon, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the operon or within the operon such as a ribosome binding site, increasing the copy number of the operon, modifying proteins ( e.g. , regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of the operon and/or translation of the gene products of the operon, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of genes routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). Deregulation can also involve altering the coding region of one or more genes to yield, for example, an enzyme that is feedback resistant or has a higher or lower specific activity. A particularly preferred \\\"recombinant\\\" cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a plant-derived gene or gene product or an microorganismally-derived gene or gene product. The term \\\"plant-derived,\\\" \\\"microorganismally-derived,\\\" or \\\"derived-from,\\\" for example, includes a gene which is naturally found in a microorganism or a plant,  e.g. , an oilseed plant, or a gene product  (e.g. , Fad5-2) or which is encoded by a plant gene or a gene from a microorganism ( e.g. , encoded SEQ ID NO:5). The methodologies of the present invention feature recombinant cells which overexpress at least one fatty acid desaturase. In another embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a  Pythium irregulare  Œî5 desaturase (the Fad5-2 gene product) ( e.g ., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 or encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5). In another embodiment, the invention features a cell ( e.g. , a microbial cell) that has been transformed with a vector comprising a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 5). Another aspect of the present invention features a method of modulating the production of fatty acids comprising culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention ( e.g. , a desaturase) such that modulation of fatty acid production occurs ( e.g. , production of unsaturated fatty acids is enhanced). The method of culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention  (e.g. , Fad5-2) to modulate the production of fatty acids is referred to herein as \\\"biotransformation.\\\" The biotransformation processes can utilize recombinant cells and/or desaturases described herein. The term \\\"biotransformation process,\\\" also referred to herein as \\\"bioconversion processes,\\\" includes biological processes which result in the production ( e.g. , transformation or conversion) of any compound ( e.g. , substrate, intermediate, or product) which is upstream of a fatty acid desaturase to a compound ( e.g. , substrate, intermediate, or product) which is downstream of a fatty acid desaturase, in particular, an unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of an unsaturated fatty acid comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses at least one fatty acid desaturase with at least one appropriate substrate under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced and, optionally, recovering the fatty acid. In a preferred embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of unsaturated fatty acids comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses Fad5-2 with an appropriate substrate ( e.g. , an intermediate fatty acid) under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid ( e.g. , DHA, SDA, or GLA) is produced and, optionally, recovering the unsaturated fatty acid. Conditions under which an unsaturated fatty acid is produced can include any conditions which result in the desired production of an unsaturated fatty acid. The cell(s) and/or enzymes used in the biotransformation reactions are in a form allowing them to perform their intended function ( e.g. , producing a desired fatty acids). The cells can be whole cells, or can be only those portions of the cells necessary to obtain the desired end result. The cells can be suspended ( e.g. , in an appropriate solution such as buffered solutions or media), rinsed ( e.g. , rinsed free of media from culturing the cell), acetone-dried, immobilized ( e.g. , with polyacrylamide gel or k-carrageenan or on synthetic supports, for example, beads, matrices and the like), fixed; cross-linked or permeablized ( e.g. , have permeablized membranes and/or walls such that compounds, for example, substrates, intermediates or products can more easily pass through said membrane or wall). The type of cell can be any cell capable of being used within the methods of the invention,  e.g. , plant, animal, or microbial cells. An important aspect of the present invention involves growing the recombinant plant or culturing the recombinant microorganisms described herein, such that a desired compound ( e.g. , a desired unsaturated fatty acid) is produced. The term \\\"culturing\\\" includes maintaining and/or growing a living microorganism of the present invention ( e.g. , maintaining and/or growing a culture or strain). In one embodiment, a microorganism is cultured in liquid media. In another embodiment, a microorganism is cultured in solid media or semi-solid media. In a preferred embodiment, a microorganism is cultured in media ( e.g ., a sterile, liquid media) comprising nutrients essential or beneficial to the maintenance and/or growth of the microorganism ( e.g ., carbon sources or carbon substrate, for example complex carbohydrates such as bean or grain meal, starches, sugars, sugar alcohols, hydrocarbons, oils, fats, fatty acids, organic acids and alcohols; nitrogen sources, for example, vegetable proteins, peptones, peptides and amino acids derived from grains, beans and tubers, proteins, peptides and amino acids derived form animal sources such as meat, milk and animal byproducts such as peptones, meat extracts and casein hydrolysates; inorganic nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate; phosphorus sources, for example, phosphoric acid, sodium and potassium salts thereof; trace elements, for example, magnesium, iron, manganese, calcium, copper, zinc; boron, molybdenum, and/or cobalt salts; as well as growth factors such as amino acids; vitamins, growth promoters and the like). Preferably, microorganisms are cultured under controlled pH. The term \\\"controlled pH\\\" includes any pH which results in production of the desired product ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of about 7. In another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.5. The desired pH may be maintained by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art. Also preferably, microorganisms cultured under controlled aeration. The term \\\"controlled aeration\\\" includes sufficient aeration ( e.g.,  oxygen) to result in production of the desired product ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, aeration is controlled by regulating oxygen levels in the culture, for example, by regulating the amount of oxygen dissolved in culture media. Preferably, aeration of the culture is controlled by agitating the culture. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the growth vessel ( e.g ., fermentor) or by various pumping equipment. Aeration may be further controlled by the passage of sterile air or oxygen through the medium ( e.g ., through the fermentation mixture). Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured without excess foaming ( e.g .,  via  addition of antifoaming agents). Moreover, plants or microorganisms can be cultured under controlled temperatures. The term \\\"controlled temperature\\\" includes any temperature which results in production of the desired product ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞C and 95¬∞C. In another embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞C and 70¬∞C. Preferred temperatures are between 20¬∞C and 55¬∞C, more preferably between 30¬∞C and 45¬∞C or between 30¬∞C and 50¬∞C. Microorganisms can be cultured ( e.g ., maintained and/or grown) in liquid media and preferably are cultured, either continuously or intermittently, by conventional culturing methods such as standing culture, test tube culture, shaking culture ( e.g ., rotary shaking culture, shake flask culture, etc.), aeration spinner culture, or fermentation. In a preferred embodiment,:the microorganisms are cultured in shake flasks. In a more preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in a fermentor ( e.g ., a fermentation process). Fermentation processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, batch, fed-batch and continuous methods of fermentation. The phrase \\\"batch process\\\" or \\\"batch fermentation\\\" refers to a closed system in which the composition of media, nutrients, supplemental additives and the like is set at the beginning of the fermentation and not subject to alteration during the fermentation, however, attempts may be made to control such factors as pH and oxygen concentration to prevent excess media acidification and/or microorganism death. The phrase \\\"fed-batch process\\\" or \\\"fed-batch\\\" fermentation refers to a batch fermentation with the exception that one or more substrates or supplements are added ( e.g ., added in increments or continuously) as the fermentation progresses. The phrase \\\"continuous process\\\" or \\\"continuous fermentation\\\" refers to a system in which a defined fermentation media is added continuously to a fermentor and an equal amount of used or \\\"conditioned\\\" media is simultaneously removed, preferably for recovery of the desired product ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). A variety of such processes have been developed and are well-known in the art. The phrase \\\"culturing under conditions such that a desired compound ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid, for example, DHA) is produced\\\" includes maintaining and/or growing plants or microorganisms under conditions ( e.g ., temperature, pressure, pH, duration, etc.) appropriate or sufficient to obtain production of the desired compound or to obtain desired yields of the particular compound being produced. For example, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to produce the desired amount of a unsaturated fatty acid ( e.g ., DHA). Preferably, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to substantially reach maximal production of the unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, culturing is continued for about 12 to 24 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for about 24 to 36 hours, 36 to 48 hours, 48 to 72 hours, 72 to 96 hours, 96 to 120 hours, 120 to 144 hours, or greater than 144 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to reach production yields of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, cells are cultured such that at least about 15 to 20 g/L of unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 20 to 25 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 25 to 30 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 30 to 35 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 35 to 40 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced ( e.g ., at least about 37 g/L unsaturated fatty acids) or at least about 40 to 50 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced. In yet another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured under conditions such that a preferred yield of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, a yield within a range set forth above, is produced in about 24 hours, in about 36 hours, in about 48 hours, in about 72 hours, or in about 96 hours. In producing unsaturated fatty acids, it may further be desirable to culture cells of the present invention in the presence of supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates. The.term \\\"supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrate\\\" includes an agent or compound which, when brought into contact with a cell or included in the culture medium of a cell, serves to enhance or increase unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates can be added in the form of a concentrated solution or suspension ( e.g ., in a suitable solvent such as water or buffer) or in the form of a solid ( e.g ., in the form of a powder). Moreover, supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added as a single aliquot, continuously or intermittently over a given period of time. The methodology of the present invention can further include a step of recovering a desired compound ( e.g ., an unsaturated fatty acid). The term \\\"recovering\\\" a desired compound includes extracting, harvesting, isolating or purifying the compound from culture media. Recovering the compound can be performed according to any conventional isolation or purification methodology known in the art including, but not limited to, treatment with a conventional resin ( e.g ., anion or cation exchange resin, nonionic adsorption resin, etc.), treatment with a conventional adsorbent ( e.g ., activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina, etc.), alteration ofpH, solvent extraction ( e.g ., with a conventional solvent such as an alcohol, ethyl acetate, hexane and the like), dialysis, filtration, concentration, crystallization, recrystallization, pH adjustment, lyophilization and the like. For example, a compound can be recovered from culture media by first removing the microorganisms from the culture. Media is then passed through or over a cation exchange resin to remove unwanted cations and then through or over an anion exchange resin to remove unwanted inorganic anions and organic acids having stronger acidities than the unsaturated fatty acid of interest ( e.g ., DHA). Preferably, a desired compound is \\\"extracted,\\\" \\\"isolated\\\" or \\\"purified\\\" such that the resulting preparation is substantially free of other components ( e.g ., free of media components and/or fermentation byproducts). The language \\\"substantially free of other components\\\" includes preparations of desired compound in which the compound is separated ( e.g ., purified or partially purified) from media components or fermentation byproducts of the culture from which it is produced. In one embodiment, the preparation has greater than about 80% (by dry weight) of the desired compound ( e.g ., less than about 20% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), more preferably greater than about 90% of the desired compound ( e.g ., less than about 10% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), still more preferably greater than about 95% of the desired compound ( e.g ., less than about 5% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), and most preferably greater than about 98-99% desired compound ( e.g ., less than about 1-2% other media components or fermentation byproducts). When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to a salt, the compound is preferably further free ( e.g ., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the salt. When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to an alcohol, the compound is preferably further free ( e.g ., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the alcohol. In an alternative embodiment, the desired unsaturated fatty acid is not purified from the plant or microorganism, for example, when the plant or microorganism is biologically non-hazardous ( e.g ., safe). For example, the entire plant or culture (or culture supernatant) can be used as a source of product ( e.g ., crude product). In one embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) supernatant is used without modification. In another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is concentrated. In yet another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is pulverized, dried, or lyophilized. B. High Yield Production Methodologies A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention is a high yield production method for producing unsaturated fatty acids,  e.g ., DHA, comprising culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that the unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a significantly high yield. The phrase \\\"high yield production method,\\\" for example, a high yield production method for producing a desired compound ( e.g ., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) includes a method that results in production of the desired compound at a level which is elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods. Preferably, a high yield production method results in production of the desired compound at a significantly high yield. The phrase \\\"significantly high yield\\\" includes a level of production or yield which is sufficiently elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods, for example, which is elevated to a level sufficient for commercial production of the desired product ( e.g ., production of the product at a commercially feasible cost). In one embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 2 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 10 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 20 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 40 g/L. The invention further features a high yield production method for producing a desired compound ( e.g ., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) that involves culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that a sufficiently elevated level of compound is produced within a commercially desirable period of time. In an exemplary embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 15-20 g/L in 36 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 25-30 g/L in 48 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 35-40 g/L in 72 hours, for example, greater that 37g/L in 72 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30-40 g/L in 60 hours, for example, greater that 30, 35 or 40 g/L in 60 hours. Values and ranges included and/or intermediate within the ranges set forth herein are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention. For example, unsaturated fatty acid production at levels of at least 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 g/L in 60 hours are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. In another example, ranges of 30-35 g/L or 35-40 g/L are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. Moreover, the skilled artisan will appreciate that culturing a manipulated microorganism to achieve a production level of, for example, \\\"30-40 g/L in 60 hours\\\" includes culturing the microorganism for additional time periods ( e.g ., time periods longer than 60 hours), optionally resulting in even higher yields of an unsaturated fatty acid being produced. IV. Compositions The desaturase nucleic acid molecules and proteins of the invention can be used to produce unsaturated fatty acids which can be incorporated into compositions. Compositions of the present invention include,  e.g ., compositions for use as animal feed, compositions for use as neutraceuticals ( e.g ., dietary supplements), and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise an unsaturated fatty acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language \\\"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\\\" is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral,  e.g ., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous; oral ( e.g ., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL‚Ñ¢ (BASF, Parsippany, NJ) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants- Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound ( e.g ., a LCPUFA, or a fragment thereof, produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound.can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange Savoring. For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant,  e.g ., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories ( e.g ., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. The active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in  U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811 . It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals,  e.g ., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 ( i.e ., the concentration of the test compounds which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide ( i.e ., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with a LCPUFA in the range of between about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody, protein, or polypeptide used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent from the results of diagnostic assays as described herein. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. EXAMPLES Material :  Pythium irregulare  was purchased from American type culture collection (12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland, 20852 USA) and grown in a medium ( Weete, J.D., et al. (1997) Lipids 32:839-845 ) at 24¬∞C for 7days. After then biomass were harvested by centrifugation and used for RNA isolation. EXAMPLE 1: CONSTRUCTION AND SCREENING OF cDNA LIBRARY Total RNA was isolated from the above materials according to Qiu and Erickson ( Qiu, X. and Erickson, L. (1994) Plant Mol.Biol. Repr. 12:209-214 ). The cDNA library was constructed from the total RNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase from Gibco-BRL. The second strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I from Stratagene. After size fractionation, cDNA inserts larger than 1 kb were ligated into Œª Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene). The recombinant ~ DNAs were then packed with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) and plated on NZY plates. The resulting library represented more than 5 x 106 independent clones. Screening of the cDNA library was performed according to standard methods ( Sambrook, J, Fritseh, E.F Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular cloning - A laboratory manual. (Cold Spring Harbor, New York, USA .) EXAMPLE 2: RT-PCR The single strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) from total RNA and was then used as the template for PCR reaction with two degenerate primers (The forward primer:\\n GCXCA/GAXGAXCAC/TCCXGGXGG and the reverse primer: ATXTG/TXGGA/GAAXAG/AG/ATGG/ATG). The PCR amplification consisted of 35 cycles with 1 min at 94¬∞ C, 1.5 min at 55 ¬∞C and 2 min at 72 ¬∞C followed by an extension step at 72 ¬∞C for 10 min. The amplified products from 800 bp to 1000 bp were isolated from agarose gel and purified by a kit (Qiaex II gel purification, Qiagen), and subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR ¬Æ 2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were then sequenced by PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). EXAMPLE 3: EXPRESSION OF FAD5-2 IN YEAST The open reading frame of Fad5-2 was amplified by PCR using the Precision Plus enzyme (Stratagene) and cloned into a TA cloning vector (pGR ¬Æ 2.1, Invitrogen). Having confirmed that the PCR products were identical to the original cDNAs by sequencing, the fragments were then released by a BamHI-EcoRI double digestion and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the inducible promoter  GAL1. Yeast strains InvSc2 (Invitrogen) was transformed with the expression constructs using the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil ( Gietz, D., et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20:1425 ;  Covello, P.S. and Reed, D.W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226 ). Transformants were first grown in minimal medium lacking uracil and containing glucose at 28¬∞C. After overnight culture, the cells were spun down, washed and resuspended in distilled water. Minimal medium containing 2% galactose, with or without 0.3 mM substrate fatty acids in the presence of 0.1 % tergitol, was inoculated with the yeast transformant cell suspension and incubated at 20¬∞C for three days, and then 15 ¬∞C for another three days. EXAMPLE 4: FATTY ACID ANALYSIS Pythium irregulare  and yeast cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water. Then 2 mL methanolic KOH (7.5% w/v KOH in 95% methanol) was added to the materials and the mixture sealed in a 12 ml glass culture tube was heated to 80¬∞C for 2 hours. 0.5 mL water was added and the sample was extracted twice with 2 mL hexane to remove the non-saponifiable lipids. The remaining aqueous phase was then acidified by adding 1 mL 6 N HCl and extracted twice with 2 mL hexane. The hexane phases were.combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. 2 mL 3 N methanolic HCl (SUPELCO, Supelco Park, Bellefonte, PA 16823-0048) was added and the mixture was heated at 80¬∞C for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL 0.9% NaCl was added and the mixture extracted twice with 2 x 2 mL hexane. The combined hexane was evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS according to Covello & Reed ( Covello, P.S. and Reed, D.W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226 ). GC/MS analysis was performed in standard EI mode using a Fisons VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, UK) controlled by Masslynx version 2.0 software, coupled to a GC 8000 Series gas chromatograph. A DB-23 column (30M x 0-25 mm i.d., 0.25 Ilm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) that was temperature-programmed at 180 ¬∞C for 1 min, then 4 C /min to 240 ¬∞C and held for 15 minutes, was used for FAME analysis. EXAMPLE 5: TRANSFORMATION OF BRASSICA JUNCEA AND FLAX (LINUM USITATISSIMUM) AND EXOGENOUS FATTY ACID TREATMENT The hypocotyls of 5-6 day seedlings of  B. juncea  and flax were used as explants for inoculation with the  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  that hosts binary vectors with the full-length cDNAs under the control of the different promoters. The 20-day transgenic seedlings were used for exogenous fatty acid treatment. The seedling was divided into three parts: leaves, stems and roots. Each was cut into the small pieces and placed in a 24-well titer plate. To each well, 2 mL 0.05% sodium salt of substrates (NuCheck Prep Inc., Elysian, MN) was added. The plate was then incubated at 24¬∞C for 4h with gentle shaking. After incubation, the plant tissues were washed three times with water and then used for fatty acid analysis. EXAMPLE 6: FATTY ACID PROFILE OF THE  THRAUSCHYTRIUM SP. Pythium irregulare  has recently drawn scientific attention due to its ability in production of LCPUFAs such as DHA, AA, EPA and DPA.  Figure 8  shows the fatty acid composition of the lipids isolated from 7 day cultures of  Pythium irregulare.  As shown in the table, the microorganism contains a broad range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from both n-3 and n-6 families. EXAMPLE 7: IDENTIFICATION OF cDNAs CODING FOR THE \\\"FRONT-END\\\" DESATURASE To identify genes coding for desaturases involved in biosynthesis of LCFCTFAs in  Pythium irregulare,  a PCR-based cloning strategy was adopted. Two degenerate primers are designed to target the heme-binding motif of N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in front-end desaturases and the third conservative histidine motif in all microsomal desaturases, respectively. The rational behind the design is that the desaturases involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis in  Pythium irregulare,  should have similar primary structure as other front-end desaturases, i.e. N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in the desaturase. Four cDNAs fragments were identified from  Pythium irregulare  that encode fusion proteins containing cyt b5-like domain in the N-terminus. To isolate full-length cDNA clones, the four inserts were used as probes to screen cDNA libraries of  Pythium irregulare;  which resulted in identification of several cDNA clones in each group. Sequencing of all those clones identified four full-length cDNAs which were named as Fad4, Fad5. Fad5-2 and Fad6. The open reading frame of Fad5-2 from  Pythium irregulare  is 1371 bp and codes for 456 amino acids ( Figure 1 ). Fad6 from  Pythium irregulare  is 1383 bp in length and codes for 460 amino acids ( Figure 2 ). Sequence comparison of the two sequences from  Pythium irregulare  showed over 39% similarity between the deduced proteins ( Figure 3 ). A BLASTP ‚Ñ¢  search of the protein database revealed the following hits for each of the four proteins, Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6: Fad 5-2  (456 amino acid residues)  Blastp nr \\n TABLE-tabl0001 Accession No. Organism Description Length % Identity AB029311 Dictostelium Fatty acid 443 41  discoideum desaturase   AB022097 Dictostelium Œî5 fatty acid 445 39  discoideum desaturase   AF067654 Mortierelta Œî5 fatty acid 441 38  alpina desaturase   AF054824 Mortierella Œî5 microsomal 441 38  alpina desaturase   L11421 Synechocystis sp.

When the yeast transformants were induced by galactose in a medium containing homo-gamma-linolenic acid (HGLA, 20:3-8;11,14), an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control. A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the fatty acid had a retention time identical to the arachidonic acid standard (AA, 20:4-5,8,11,14). To further confirm the regiochemistry of the products, the FAMEs were analyzed by GC/MS. The mass spectra of the new fatty acid and the AA standard are identical. These results demonstrate that Fad5 and Fad5-2 convert HGLA (20:3-8,11,13) into AA (20:4-5,8,11,14) in yeast. To further study the substrate specificity of Fad5-2, the plasmid containing  Fad5-2  was transferred into another yeast strain AMY-2Œ± where olel, a Œî9 desaturase gene, is disrupted. The strain is unable to grow in minimal media without supplementation with mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In this experiment, the strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 17:1(10Z), a non-substrate of Fad5-2, which enabled study of the specificity of the enzyme towards various substrates, especially monounsaturates. A number of possible substrates including 16:1(9Z), 18:1(9Z), 18:1(11Z), 18:1(11 E ), 18:1(12 E ), 18:1(15Z), 18:2(9Z,12Z), 18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z), 20:2(11Z,14Z) and 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) were tested. Results indicated that Fad5-2 could desaturate unsaturated fatty acids with Œî9 ethylenic and Œî11 ethylenic double bonds, as well as the fatty acid with Œî8 ethylenic double bond (20:3-8,11,14). As shown in  Figure 4 , Fad5-2 effectively converted both 18:1(9Z) and 18:1(11Z) substrates into their corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids, 18:2-5,9 (the retention time 10.34 min) and 18:1-5,11 (the retention time 10.44 min), respectively. Fad5-2 also desaturated  trans  fatty acid such as 18:1(11 E ) and 18:1(12 E ). Figure 9  is a comparison of substrate preference of Fad5-2 for fatty acid substrates tested in the yeast strain AMY-2Œ±. The relative proportions of the substrates and the products accumulated are a useful indicator of substrate preference of the enzyme. As shown in  Figure 9 , Fad5-2 prefers fatty acids with 20-carbon as substrates, such as 20:3 (8Z,11Z,14Z), 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) and 20:2(11Z,14Z). Whereas, the shorter chain fatty acid is a relatively weaker substrate for the enzyme in yeast. EXAMPLE 9: EXPRESSION OF Fad5-2 IN  B. JUNCEA To determine whether Fad5-2 is functional in oilseed crops and its expression has any effect on their growth and development,  B. juncea  were transformed with a binary vector that contained Fad5-2 cDNA behind a constitutive promoter (a tandem cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter). Six independent primary transgenic plants were obtained and the fatty acid profile of lipids from different tissues was determined.  Figure 5  shows the fatty acid composition of three-week-old seedling plants from one T 1'  line. Compared with wild type, all transgenic plant tissues have an altered fatty acid profile containing four additional peaks which were identified as four different Œî5-undesaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids (Œî5-UPIFAs), specifically, taxoleic (18:2-5,9); ephedrenic (18:2-5,11); pinolenic (18:3-5,9,12), and coniferonic acids (18:4-5,9,12,15). Thus  B. juncea,  like yeast, can functionally express the  P. irregulare  Œî5 desaturase to convert the endogenous substrates 18:1-9; 18:1-11; 18:2-9,12, and 18:3-9,12,15 to the corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids. The roots produced the highest amount of the Œî5 UPIFAs, representing more than 20% of the total fatty acids, followed by 6% in stems and 5% in leaves ( Figure 5 ). In  B. juncea  there is no homo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3-8,11,14) substrate available. Thus, to examine whether the transgenic plant can produce AA, the substrate 20:3(8,11,14) was exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium homo-gamma-linolenate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of transgenic plants and converted into AA in plants ( Figure 6 ). There was no observable phenotypic effect on the growth and development in the transgenic  B .  juncea,  although the Œî5-UPIFAs accumulated in all parts of the plant. Growth and differentiation of vegetative tissues such as the leaves, stems, and roots were indistinguishable from the corresponding wild type. To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in seeds,  B. juncea  were transformed with the construct containing  Fad5-2  cDNA behind a heterologous seed-specific promoter  (B. napus  napin promoter). Fatty acid analysis of transgenic seeds showed that there were two new fatty acids appearing in the gas chromatogram of transgenics compared with the wild type control ( Figure 7 ). They were identified as taxoleic acid (18:2-5,9) and pinolenic acids (18:3-5,9,12). Together, these fatty acids represent 9.4 % of the seed fatty acids. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs has no significant effect on the oleic acid content compared with the untransformed control. EXAMPLE 10: EXPRESSION OF FAD5-2 IN FLAX To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, flax was transformed with  Fad5-2  under the control of two seed-specific promoters, a heterologous  B. napus  napin promoter, and a flax endogenous promoter. As shown in Figure 26, transgenic plants containing the napin promoter produced one Œî5-desaturated fatty acid, taxoleic acid in seeds at the level of less than 1% of the total fatty acids. Whereas transgenic plants containing the flax seed-specific promoter produced three Œî5 desaturated fatty acids: taxoleic, pinolenic, and coniferonic acid. Of these, taxoleic (18:2-5,9) was the most abundant and accounted for more than 9% of the total fatty acids in a elite line (FN-10-1), followed by coniferonic and pinolenic acids. Surprisingly, accumulation of Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in transgenic seeds has significant impact on the composition of other fatty acids, especially the oleic acid level. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs was accompanied by a huge increase of the oleic acids in both types of transgenic plants expressing Fad5-2 desaturase under the control of the different promoters. The content of oleic acid in transgenic plants with the napin and flax seed-specific promoters, on the average, reached 44.7% and 24.3% of the total fatty acids, respectively, relative to the untransformed control at 17.4%. Equivalents Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fatty acids are carboxylic acids with long-chain hydrocarbon side groups and play a fundamental role in many biological processes. Fatty acids are rarely free in nature but, rather, occur in esterified form as the major component of lipids. Lipids/fatty acids are sources of energy (e.g., b-oxidation) and are an integral part of cell membranes which are indispensable for processing biological or biochemical information. Fatty acids can be divided into two groups: the saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids which contain one or more carbon double bond in cis-configuration. Unsaturated fatty acids are produced by terminal desaturases that belong to the class of nonheme-iron enzymes. Each of these enzymes are part of a electron-transport system that contains two other proteins, namely cytochrome b 5 and NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. Human and other mammals have a limited spectrum of these desaturases that are required for the formation of particular double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, humans have to take up some fatty acids through their diet. Such essential fatty acids, for example, are linoleic acid (C18:2); linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4). In contrast, insects and plants are able to synthesize a much larger variety of unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)) are essential components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). For example, over 30% of fatty acids in brain phospholipid are 22:6 (n-3) and 20:4 (n-6). (Crawford, M. A., et al., (1997) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66:1032 S-1041S). In retina, DHA accounts for more than 60% of the total fatty acids in the rod outer segment, the photosensitive part of the photoreceptor cell. (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has significant effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, some positive effects of DHA were also found on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Therefore, the appropriate dietary supply of the fatty acid is important for humans to remain healthy. It is particularly important for infant, young children and senior citizens to adequately intake these fatty acids from the diet since they cannot be efficiently synthesized in their body and must be supplemented by food (Spector, A. A. (1999) Lipids 34:S1-S3). DHA is a fatty acid of the n-3 series according to the location of the last double bond in the methyl end. It is synthesized via alternating steps of desaturation and elongation. Starting with 18:3 (9,12,15), biosynthesis of DHA involves Œî6 desaturation to 18:4 (6,9,12,15), followed by elongation to 20:4 (8,11,14,17) and Œî5 desaturation to 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17). Beyond this point, there are some controversies about the biosynthesis. The conventional view is that 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17) is elongated to 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19) and then converted to 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19) by the final Œî4 desaturation (Horrobin, D. F. (1992) Prog. Lipid Res. 31:163-194). However, Sprecher et al. recently suggested an alternative pathway for DHA biosynthesis, which is independent of Œî4 desaturase, involving two consecutive elongations, a Œî6 desaturation and a two-carbon shortening via limited n-oxidation in peroxisome (Sprecher, H., et al. (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36:2471-2477; Sprecher, H., et al. (1999) Lipids 34:S153-S156). Production of DHA is important because of its beneficial effect on human health. Currently the major sources of DHA are oils from fish and algae. Fish oil is a major and traditional source for this fatty acid, however, it is usually oxidized by the time it is sold. In addition, the supply of the oil is highly variable and its source is in jeopardy with the shrinking fish populations while the algal source is expensive due to low yield and the high costs of extraction. EPA and AA are both Œî5 essential fatty acids. They form a unique class of food and feed constituents for humans and animals. EPA belongs to the n-3 series with five double bonds in the acyl chain, is found in marine food, and is abundant in oily fish from North Atlantic. AA belongs to the n-6 series with four double bonds. The lack of a double bond in the œâ-3 position confers on AA different properties than those found in EPA. The eicosanoids produced from AA have strong inflammatory and platelet aggregating properties, whereas those derived from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet aggregating properties. AA can be obtained from some foods such as meat, fish, and eggs, but the concentration is low. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is another essential fatty acid found in mammals. GLA is the metabolic intermediate for very long chain n-6 fatty acids and for various active molecules. In mammals, formation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is rate-limited by Œî6 desaturation. Many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, stress, diabetes, eczema, and some infections have been shown to depress the Œî6 desaturation step. In addition, GLA is readily catabolized from the oxidation and rapid cell division associated with certain disorders, e.g., cancer or inflammation. Therefore, dietary supplementation with GLA can reduce the risks of these disorders. Clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation with GLA is effective in treating some pathological conditions such as atopic eczema, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders. The predominant sources of GLA are oils from plants such as evening primrose ( Oenothera biennis ), borage ( Borago officinalis L.), black currant ( Ribes nigrum ), and from microorganisms such as Mortierella sp., Mucor sp., and Cyanobacteria . However, these GLA sources are not ideal for dietary supplementation due to large fluctuations in availability and costs associated with extraction processes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The biosynthesis of fatty acids is a major activity of plants and microorganisms. However, humans have a limited capacity for synthesizing essential fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Biotechnology has long been considered an efficient way to manipulate the process of producing fatty acids in plants and microorganisms. It is cost-effective and renewable with little side effects. Thus, tremendous industrial effort directed to the production of various compounds including specialty fatty acids and pharmaceutical polypeptides through the manipulation of plant, animal, and microorganismal cells has ensued. Accordingly, biotechnology is an attractive route for producing unsaturated fatty acids, especially LCPUFAs, in a safe, cost-efficient manner so as to garner the maximum therapeutic value from these fatty acids. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a family of nucleic acid molecules encoding novel desaturases. In particular, the present inventors have identified the Fad 4 (Œî4 desaturase), Fad5 and Fad5-2 (Œî5 desaturase), and Fad6 (Œî6 desaturase) which are involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6, n-3) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5, n-6); more specifically, Fad4 desaturases 22:5 (n-3) and 22:4 (n-6) resulting in DHA and DPA; Fad5 and Fad5-2 desaturases 20:4 (n-3) and 20:3(n-6) resulting in EPA and AA; and Fad6 desaturases 18:2 (n-6) and 18:3(n-3) resulting in GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) and SDA (stearidonic acid).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of novel fatty acid desaturase family members, referred to interchangeably herein as ‚Äúdesaturases‚Äù or ‚Äúdesaturase‚Äù nucleic acid and protein molecules (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6). These novel molecules are members of the fatty acid desaturase family and are expressed in LCPUFAs-producing organisms, e.g., Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare, Schizichytrium , and Crythecodinium. As used herein, the term ‚Äúfatty acids‚Äù is art recognized and includes a long-chain hydrocarbon based carboxylic acid. Fatty acids are components of many lipids including glycerides. The most common naturally occurring fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids which have an even number of carbon atoms (16 or 18) and which may be saturated or unsaturated. ‚ÄúUnsaturated‚Äù fatty acids contain cis double bonds between the carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids encompassed by the present invention include, for example, DHA, GLA, and SDA. ‚ÄúPolyunsaturated‚Äù fatty acids contain more than one double bond and the double bonds are arranged in a methylene interrupted system (‚ÄîCH‚ïêCH‚ÄîCH 2 ‚ÄîCH‚ïêCH‚Äî). Fatty acids are described herein by a numbering system in which the number before the colon indicates the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, whereas the number after the colon is the number of double bonds that are present. In the case of unsaturated fatty acids, this is followed by a number in parentheses that indicates the position of the double bonds. Each number in parenthesis is the lower numbered carbon atom of the two connected by the double bond. For example, oleic acid can be described as 18:1(9) and linoleic acid can be described as 18:2(9, 12) indicating 18 carbons, one double bond at carbon 9, two double bonds at carbons 9 and 12, respectively. The controlling steps in the production of unsaturated fatty acids, i.e., the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, are catalyzed by membrane-associated fatty acid desaturases, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. As used herein, the term ‚Äúunsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway‚Äù refers to a series of chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of an unsaturated fatty acid either in vivo or in vitro. Such a pathway includes a series of desaturation and elongation steps which generate unsaturated fatty acids and ultimately, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Such unsaturated fatty acids can include, GLA 18:3 (6,9,12), SDA 18:4 (6,9,12,15), AA 20:4 (5,8,11,14), EPA 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17), and DPA 22:5 (4,7,10,13,16), and DHA 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19). Desaturases can contain a heme-binding motif and/or about three conservative histidine motifs, although additional domains may be present. Members of the fatty acid desaturase family convert saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), which are components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). Examples of LCPUFA include, among others, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, positive effects of DHA were also found in the treatment of diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Thus, the desaturase molecules can be used to produce the LCPUFAs useful in treating disorders characterized by aberrantly regulated growth, proliferation, or differentiation. Such disorders include cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, or leukemia; tumor angiogenesis and metastasis; skeletal dysplasia; hepatic disorders; myelodysplastic syndromes; and hematopoietic and/or myeloproliferative disorders. Other disorders related to angiogenesis and which are, therefore, desaturase associated disorders include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. The term ‚Äúfamily‚Äù when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention is intended to mean two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin or alternatively, can contain homologues of non-human origin, e.g., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. For example, the family of desaturase proteins of the present invention comprises one cytochrome b5 heme-binding motif. As used herein, the term ‚Äúheme-binding motif‚Äù is an N-terminal extension of the cytochrome b5-like domain found in front-end desaturases. In another embodiment, members of the desaturase family of proteins include a ‚Äúhistidine motifs‚Äù in the protein, preferably, about three or four histidine motifs. As used herein, the term ‚Äúhistidine motif‚Äù includes a protein domain having at least about two histidine amino acid residues, preferably about three or four histidine amino acid residues, and is typically found in all microsomal desaturases as the third conservative histidine motif. Examples of cytochrome b5 heme-binding motifs and histidine motifs include amino acid residues 41-44, 182-186, 216-223, and 453-462 of SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 40-43, 171-175, 207-213, and 375-384 of SEQ ID NO:4, amino acid residues 40-45, 171-176, 208-213, and 395-400 of SEQ ID NO:6, and amino acid residues 42-47, 178-183, 215-220, and 400-405 of SEQ ID NO:8, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 6 . Isolated desaturase proteins of the present invention have an amino acid sequence sufficiently homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 or are encoded by a nucleotide sequence sufficiently homologous to SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5 or 7. As used herein, the term ‚Äúsufficiently homologous‚Äù refers to a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence which contains a sufficient or minimum number of identical or equivalent (e.g., an amino acid residue which has a similar side chain) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleotide sequences share common structural domains or motifs and/or a common functional activity. For example, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share common structural domains having at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity across the amino acid sequences of the domains and contain at least one and preferably two structural domains or motifs, are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. Furthermore, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity and share a common functional activity are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains or motifs: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif and has an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous or identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif, and is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one heme-binding motif and/or at least about three histidine motifs, and has a desaturase activity. As used interchangeably herein, a ‚Äúdesaturase activity,‚Äù ‚Äúbiological activity of a desaturase,‚Äù or ‚Äúfunctional activity of a desaturase,‚Äù includes an activity exerted or mediated by a desaturase protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on a desaturase responsive cell or on a desaturase substrate, as determined in vivo or in vitro, according to standard techniques. In one embodiment, a desaturase activity is a direct activity such as an association with a desaturase target molecule. As used herein, a ‚Äútarget molecule‚Äù or ‚Äúbinding partner‚Äù is a molecule e.g., a molecule involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, with which a desaturase protein binds or interacts in nature such that a desaturase-mediated function is achieved. A desaturase direct activity also includes the formation of a double bond between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule to form an unsaturated fatty acid molecule. The nucleotide sequence of the isolated Thraustochytrium sp. Œî4 desaturase, Fad4, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad4 cDNA are shown in FIG. 1 and in SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad4 gene (the open reading frame), which is approximately 1560 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 59.1 kD and which is approximately 519 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Thraustochytrium sp. Œî5 desaturase, Fad5, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5 cDNA are shown in FIG. 2 and in SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad5 gene, which is approximately 1320 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 49.8 kD and which is approximately 439 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî5 desaturase, Fad5-2, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5-2 cDNA are shown in FIG. 4 and in SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad5-2 gene, which is approximately 1371 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 456 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî6 desaturase, Fad6, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad6 cDNA are shown in FIG. 5 and in SEQ ID NOs: 7 and 8, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad6 gene, which is approximately 1383 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 460 amino acid residues in length. Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections: I. Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode desaturase proteins or biologically active portions thereof, as well as nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify desaturase-encoding nucleic acid molecules (e.g., desaturase mRNA) and fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of desaturase nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term ‚Äúnucleic acid molecule‚Äù is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. The term ‚Äúisolated nucleic acid molecule‚Äù includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term ‚Äúisolated‚Äù includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an ‚Äúisolated‚Äù nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated desaturase nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an ‚Äúisolated‚Äù nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, e.g., a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, or a portion thereof, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information provided herein. Using all or a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, as hybridization probes, desaturase nucleic acid molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook, J. et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd , ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule encompassing all or a portion of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, can be isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed based upon the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A nucleic acid of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to desaturase nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule consists of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, or a portion of any of these nucleotide sequences. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 is one which is sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that it can hybridize to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby forming a stable duplex. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 (e.g., to the entire length of the nucleotide sequence), or a portion or complement of any of these nucleotide sequences. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least (or no greater than) 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-750, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. Moreover, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, a fragment which can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding a portion of a desaturase protein, e.g., a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein. The nucleotide sequence determined from the cloning of the desaturase gene allows for the generation of probes and primers designed for use in identifying and/or cloning other desaturase family members, as well as desaturase homologues from other species. The probe/primer (e.g., oligonucleotide) typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 12 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 75 consecutive nucleotides of a sense sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5 or 7, of an anti-sense sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or of a naturally occurring allelic variant or mutant of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Exemplary probes or primers are at least (or no greater than) 12 or 15, 20 or 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or more nucleotides in length and/or comprise consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein. Also included within the scope of the present invention are probes or primers comprising contiguous or consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein, but for the difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases within the probe or primer sequence. Probes based on the desaturase nucleotide sequences can be used to detect (e.g., specifically detect) transcripts or genomic sequences encoding the same or homologous proteins. In preferred embodiments, the probe further comprises a label group attached thereto, e.g., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. In another embodiment a set of primers is provided, e.g., primers suitable for use in a PCR, which can be used to amplify a selected region of a desaturase sequence, e.g., a domain, region, site or other sequence described herein. The primers should be at least 5, 10, or 50 base pairs in length and less than 100, or less than 200, base pairs in length. The primers should be identical, or differ by no greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases when compared to a sequence disclosed herein or to the sequence of a naturally occurring variant. Such probes can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissue which misexpress a desaturase protein, such as by measuring a level of a desaturase-encoding nucleic acid in a sample of cells from a subject, e.g., detecting desaturase mRNA levels or determining whether a genomic desaturase gene has been mutated or deleted. A nucleic acid fragment encoding a ‚Äúbiologically active portion of a desaturase protein‚Äù can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, which encodes a polypeptide having a desaturase biological activity (the biological activities of the desaturase proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the desaturase protein (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro) and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the desaturase protein. In an exemplary embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and encodes a protein having a desaturase activity (as described herein). The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same desaturase proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs by at least 1, but no greater than 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 amino acid residues from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the amino acid sequence of human desaturase. If an alignment is needed for this comparison, the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. Nucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologues (different locus), and orthologues (different organism) or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product). Allelic variants result, for example, from DNA sequence polymorphisms within a population (e.g., the human population) that lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the desaturase proteins. Such genetic polymorphism in the desaturase genes may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. As used herein, the terms ‚Äúgene‚Äù and ‚Äúrecombinant gene‚Äù refer to nucleic acid molecules which include an open reading frame encoding a desaturase protein, e.g., oilseed desaturase protein, and can further include non-coding regulatory sequences, and introns. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a naturally occurring allelic variant of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, wherein the nucleic acid molecule hybridizes to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions. Allelic variants of desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, include both functional and non-functional desaturase proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein that maintain the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., a fatty acid, e.g., 22:5(n-3)); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. The fatty acids produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention are also useful in treating disorders such as aging, stress, diabetes, cancer, inflammatory disorders (e.g., arthritis, eczema), and cardiovascular disorders. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only a conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Non-functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, that do not have the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, such as 18:4(6,9,12,15)); and/or (ii) faun a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. The present invention further provides orthologues (e.g., human orthologues of the desaturase proteins). Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins are proteins that are isolated from other organisms and possess the same desaturase substrate or target molecule binding mechanisms, double bond forming mechanisms, modulating mechanisms of growth and development of the brain in infants, maintenance mechanisms of normal brain function in adults, ability to affect photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, ability to affect rhodopsin activation, development mechanisms of rods and/or cones, and/or modulating mechanisms of cellular growth and/or proliferation of the non-human desaturase proteins. Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins can readily be identified as comprising an amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other desaturase family members and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, another desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins from different species, and which, thus, have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, Schizochytrium or Crythecodinium desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the desaturase cDNAs of the invention can be isolated based on their homology to the desaturase nucleic acids disclosed herein using the cDNAs disclosed herein, or a portion thereof, as a hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent hybridization conditions. Orthologues, homologues and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art (e.g., by hybridization to an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions). In one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention is at least 15, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In other embodiment, the nucleic acid is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length. As used herein, the term ‚Äúhybridizes under stringent conditions‚Äù is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences that are significantly identical or homologous to each other remain hybridized to each other. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% identical to each other remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1995), sections 2, 4, and 6. Additional stringent conditions can be found in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual , Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), chapters 7, 9, and 11. A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4√ó sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 4√óSSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 1√óSSC, at about 65-70¬∞ C. A preferred, non-limiting example of highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 1√óSSC, at about 65-70¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 1√óSSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 0.3√óSSC, at about 65-70¬∞ C. A preferred, non-limiting example of reduced stringency hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4√óSSC, at about 50-60¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 6√óSSC plus 50% formamide at about 40-45¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 2√óSSC, at about 50-60¬∞ C. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values, e.g., at 65-70¬∞ C. or at 42-50¬∞ C. are also intended to be encompassed by the present invention. SSPE (1√óSSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1√óSSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-10¬∞ C. less than the melting temperature (T m ) of the hybrid, where T m is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞ C.)=2(# of A+T bases)+4(# of G+C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞ C.)=81.5+16.6(log 10 [Na + ])+0.41(% G+C)‚àí(600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na + ] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer ([Na + ] for 1√óSSC=0.165 M). It will also be recognized by the skilled practitioner that additional reagents may be added to hybridization and/or wash buffers to decrease non-specific hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to membranes, for example, nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, including but not limited to blocking agents (e.g., BSA or salmon or herring sperm carrier DNA), detergents (e.g., SDS), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA), Ficoll, PVP and the like. When using nylon membranes, in particular, an additional preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 0.25-0.5M NaH 2 PO 4 , 7% SDS at about 65¬∞ C., followed by one or more washes at 0.02M NaH 2 PO 4 , 1% SDS at 65¬∞ C. (see e.g., Church and Gilbert (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1991-1995), or alternatively 0.2√óSSC, 1% SDS. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a ‚Äúnaturally-occurring‚Äù nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature (e.g., encodes a natural protein). In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of the desaturase sequences that may exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by mutation into the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded desaturase proteins, without altering the functional ability of the desaturase proteins. For example, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù amino acid residues can be made in the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 (e.g., the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8) without altering the biological activity, whereas an ‚Äúessential‚Äù amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the desaturase proteins of the present invention, e.g., those present in a heme-binding motif or a histidine motif, are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. Furthermore, additional amino acid residues that are conserved between the desaturase proteins of the present invention and other members of the fatty acid desaturase family are not likely to be amenable to alteration. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such desaturase proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, yet retain biological activity. In one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, wherein the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% 99% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, e.g., to the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a desaturase protein homologous to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A ‚Äúconservative amino acid substitution‚Äù is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a desaturase protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a desaturase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for desaturase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. In a preferred embodiment, a mutant desaturase protein can be assayed for the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. II. Isolated Desaturase Proteins One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated or recombinant desaturase proteins and polypeptides, and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment, native desaturase proteins can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, desaturase proteins are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a desaturase protein or polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. An ‚Äúisolated‚Äù or ‚Äúpurified‚Äù protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the desaturase protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of cellular material‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language ‚Äúsubstantially free of cellular material‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, or 30% (by dry weight) of non-desaturase protein (also referred to herein as a ‚Äúcontaminating protein‚Äù), more preferably less than about 20% of non-desaturase protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-desaturase protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-desaturase protein. When the desaturase protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language ‚Äúsubstantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals. It should be understood that the proteins or this invention can also be in a form which is different than their corresponding naturally occurring proteins and/or which is still in association with at least some cellular components. For example, the protein can be associated with a cellular membrane. As used herein, a ‚Äúbiologically active portion‚Äù of a desaturase protein includes a fragment of a desaturase protein which participates in an interaction between a desaturase molecule and a non-desaturase molecule (e.g., a desaturase substrate such as fatty acid). Biologically active portions of a desaturase protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the desaturase amino acid sequences, e.g., the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 which include sufficient amino acid residues to exhibit at least one activity of a desaturase protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the desaturase protein; the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) faun a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. A biologically active portion of a desaturase protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200 or more amino acids in length. In one embodiment, a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein comprises a heme-binding motif and/or at least one histidine motifs, preferably about three histidine motifs. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native desaturase protein. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In other embodiments, the desaturase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, yet differs in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. In another embodiment, the desaturase protein is a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In another embodiment, the invention features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. This invention further features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison, purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the length of the reference sequence (e.g., when aligning a second sequence to the Fad4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 having 519 amino acid residues, at least 156, preferably at least 208, more preferably at least 260, even more preferably at least 311, and even more preferably at least 363, 415, or 467 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 having 439 amino acid residues, at least 132, preferably at least 176, more preferably at least 220, even more preferably at least 263, and even more preferably at least 307, 351, or 395 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5-2 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 having 456 amino acid residues, at least 137, preferably at least 182, more preferably at least 228, even more preferably at least 273, and even more preferably at least 319, 365, or 419 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad6 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8 having 460 amino acid residues, at least 138, preferably at least 184, more preferably at least 230, even more preferably at least 276, and even more preferably at least 322, 368, or 414 amino acid residues are aligned). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid ‚Äúidentity‚Äù is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid ‚Äúhomology‚Äù). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch ( J. Mol. Biol . (48):444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package, using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A preferred, non-limiting example of parameters to be used in conjunction with the GAP program include a Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller ( Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:11-17 (1988)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0 or version 2.0U), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a ‚Äúquery sequence‚Äù to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to desaturase nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to desaturase protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. III. Methods of Producing Unsaturated Fatty Acids The present invention provides new and improved methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., LCPUFAs, such as, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 (n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 (n-6)), AA (Arachidonic acid, 20:4 (n-6)) and EPA (eicosapentaenioc acid, 20:5(n-3)). A. Recombinant Cells and Methods for Culturing Cells The present invention further features recombinant vectors that include nucleic acid sequences that encode the gene products as described herein, preferably Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 gene products. The term recombinant vector includes a vector (e.g., plasmid) that has been altered, modified or engineered such that it contains greater, fewer or different nucleic acid sequences than those included in the native vector or plasmid. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector includes the nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one fatty acid desaturase enzyme operably linked to regulatory sequences. The phrase ‚Äúoperably linked to regulatory sequence(s)‚Äù means that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression (e.g., enhanced, increased, constitutive, basal, attenuated, decreased or repressed expression) of the nucleotide sequence, preferably expression of a gene product encoded by the nucleotide sequence (e.g., when the recombinant vector is introduced into a cell). Exemplary vectors are described in further detail herein as well as in, for example, Frascotti et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,137, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The term ‚Äúregulatory sequence‚Äù includes nucleic acid sequences which affect (e.g., modulate or regulate) expression of other (non-regulatory) nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence is included in a recombinant vector in a similar or identical position and/or orientation relative to a particular gene of interest as is observed for the regulatory sequence and gene of interest as it appears in nature, e.g., in a native position and/or orientation. For example, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to the gene in the natural organism (e.g., operably linked to ‚Äúnative‚Äù Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequence (e.g., to the ‚Äúnative‚Äù Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 promoter). Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to another (e.g., a different) gene in the natural organism. For example, a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene can be included in a vector operably linked to non-Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequences. Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence from another organism. For example, regulatory sequences from other microbes (e.g., other bacterial regulatory sequences, bacteriophage regulatory sequences and the like) can be operably linked to a particular gene of interest. Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers, termination signals and other expression control elements (e.g., binding sites for transcriptional and/or translational regulatory proteins, for example, in the transcribed mRNA). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., constitutive promoters and strong constitutive promoters), those which direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., inducible promoters, for example, xylose inducible promoters) and those which attenuate or repress expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., attenuation signals or repressor sequences). It is also within the scope of the present invention to regulate expression of a gene of interest by removing or deleting regulatory sequences. For example, sequences involved in the negative regulation of transcription can be removed such that expression of a gene of interest is enhanced. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes nucleic acid sequences that encode at least one gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) operably linked to a promoter or promoter sequence. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes a terminator sequence or terminator sequences (e.g., transcription terminator sequences). The term ‚Äúterminator sequences‚Äù includes regulatory sequences which serve to terminate transcription of mRNA. Terminator sequences (or tandem transcription terminators) can further serve to stabilize mRNA (e.g., by adding structure to mRNA), for example, against nucleases. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes antibiotic resistance sequences. The term ‚Äúantibiotic resistance sequences‚Äù includes sequences which promote or confer resistance to antibiotics on the host organism. In one embodiment, the antibiotic resistance sequences are selected from the group consisting of cat (chloramphenicol resistance), tet (tetracycline resistance) sequences, erm (erythromycin resistance) sequences, neo (neomycin resistance) sequences and spec (spectinomycin resistance) sequences. Recombinant vectors of the present invention can further include homologous recombination sequences (e.g., sequences designed to allow recombination of the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host organism). For example, amyE sequences can be used as homology targets for recombination into the host chromosome. The term ‚Äúmanipulated cell‚Äù includes a cell that has been engineered (e.g., genetically engineered) or modified such that the cell has at least one fatty acid desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6, such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced. Modification or engineering of such microorganisms can be according to any methodology described herein including, but not limited to, deregulation of a biosynthetic pathway and/or overexpression of at least one biosynthetic enzyme. A ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù enzyme (e.g., a ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù biosynthetic enzyme) includes an enzyme, the expression or production of which has been altered or modified such that at least one upstream or downstream precursor, substrate or product of the enzyme is altered or modified, for example, as compared to a corresponding wild-type or naturally occurring enzyme. The term ‚Äúoverexpressed‚Äù or ‚Äúoverexpression‚Äù includes expression of a gene product (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase) at a level greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. In one embodiment, the cell can be genetically manipulated (e.g., genetically engineered) to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. Genetic manipulation can include, but is not limited to, altering or modifying regulatory sequences or sites associated with expression of a particular gene (e.g., by adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or by removing regulatory sequences such that expression is constitutive), modifying the chromosomal location of a particular gene, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to a particular gene such as a ribosome binding site or transcription terminator, increasing the copy number of a particular gene, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of a particular gene routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). In another embodiment, the cell can be physically or environmentally manipulated to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. For example, a cell can be treated with or cultured in the presence of an agent known or suspected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. Alternatively, a cell can be cultured at a temperature selected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. The term ‚Äúderegulated‚Äù or ‚Äúderegulation‚Äù includes the alteration or modification of at least one gene in a cell that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway, such that the level or activity of the biosynthetic enzyme in the cell is altered or modified. Preferably, at least one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the gene product is enhanced or increased. The phrase ‚Äúderegulated pathway‚Äù can also include a biosynthetic pathway in which more than one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the level or activity of more than one biosynthetic enzyme is altered or modified. The ability to ‚Äúderegulate‚Äù a pathway (e.g., to simultaneously deregulate more than one gene in a given biosynthetic pathway) in a cell arises from the particular phenomenon of cells in which more than one enzyme (e.g., two or three biosynthetic enzymes) are encoded by genes occurring adjacent to one another on a contiguous piece of genetic material termed an ‚Äúoperon‚Äù. The term ‚Äúoperon‚Äù includes a coordinated unit of gene expression that contains a promoter and possibly a regulatory element associated with one or more, preferably at least two, structural genes (e.g., genes encoding enzymes, for example, biosynthetic enzymes). Expression of the structural genes can be coordinately regulated, for example, by regulatory proteins binding to the regulatory element or by anti-termination of transcription. The structural genes can be transcribed to give a single mRNA that encodes all of the structural proteins. Due to the coordinated regulation of genes included in an operon, alteration or modification of the single promoter and/or regulatory element can result in alteration or modification of each gene product encoded by the operon. Alteration or modification of the regulatory element can include, but is not limited to removing the endogenous promoter and/or regulatory element(s), adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or removing regulatory sequences such that expression of the gene products is modified, modifying the chromosomal location of the operon, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the operon or within the operon such as a ribosome binding site, increasing the copy number of the operon, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of the operon and/or translation of the gene products of the operon, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of genes routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). Deregulation can also involve altering the coding region of one or more genes to yield, for example, an enzyme that is feedback resistant or has a higher or lower specific activity. A particularly preferred ‚Äúrecombinant‚Äù cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a plant-derived gene or gene product or an microorganismally-derived gene or gene product. The term ‚Äúplant-derived,‚Äù ‚Äúmicroorganismally-derived,‚Äù or ‚Äúderived-from,‚Äù for example, includes a gene which is naturally found in a microorganism or a plant, e.g., an oilseed plant, or a gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) or which is encoded by a plant gene or a gene from a microorganism (e.g., encoded SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7). The methodologies of the present invention feature recombinant cells which overexpress at least one fatty acid desaturase. In one embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Thrauschytrium sp. fatty acid desaturase (e.g., has been engineered to overexpress at least one of Thrauschytrium sp. Œî4 or Œî5 desaturase (the Fad4 or Fad5 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or 4 or encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3). In another embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Pythium irregulare Œî5 or Œî6 desaturase (the Fad5-2 or Fad6 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8 or encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 or 7). In another embodiment, the invention features a cell (e.g., a microbial cell) that has been transformed with a vector comprising a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7). Another aspect of the present invention features a method of modulating the production of fatty acids comprising culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., a desaturase) such that modulation of fatty acid production occurs (e.g., production of unsaturated fatty acids is enhanced). The method of culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6) to modulate the production of fatty acids is referred to herein as ‚Äúbiotransformation.‚Äù The biotransformation processes can utilize recombinant cells and/or desaturases described herein. The term ‚Äúbiotransformation process,‚Äù also referred to herein as ‚Äúbioconversion processes,‚Äù includes biological processes which result in the production (e.g., transformation or conversion) of any compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is upstream of a fatty acid desaturase to a compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is downstream of a fatty acid desaturase, in particular, an unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of an unsaturated fatty acid comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses at least one fatty acid desaturase with at least one appropriate substrate under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced and, optionally, recovering the fatty acid. In a preferred embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of unsaturated fatty acids comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 with an appropriate substrate (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid) under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA, SDA, or GLA) is produced and, optionally, recovering the unsaturated fatty acid. Conditions under which an unsaturated fatty acid is produced can include any conditions which result in the desired production of an unsaturated fatty acid. The cell(s) and/or enzymes used in the biotransformation reactions are in a form allowing them to perform their intended function (e.g., producing a desired fatty acids). The cells can be whole cells, or can be only those portions of the cells necessary to obtain the desired end result. The cells can be suspended (e.g., in an appropriate solution such as buffered solutions or media), rinsed (e.g., rinsed free of media from culturing the cell), acetone-dried, immobilized (e.g., with polyacrylamide gel or k-carrageenan or on synthetic supports, for example, beads, matrices and the like), fixed, cross-linked or permeablized (e.g., have permeablized membranes and/or walls such that compounds, for example, substrates, intermediates or products can more easily pass through said membrane or wall). The type of cell can be any cell capable of being used within the methods of the invention, e.g., plant, animal, or microbial cells. An important aspect of the present invention involves growing the recombinant plant or culturing the recombinant microorganisms described herein, such that a desired compound (e.g., a desired unsaturated fatty acid) is produced. The term ‚Äúculturing‚Äù includes maintaining and/or growing a living microorganism of the present invention (e.g., maintaining and/or growing a culture or strain). In one embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in liquid media. In another embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in solid media or semi-solid media. In a preferred embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in media (e.g., a sterile, liquid media) comprising nutrients essential or beneficial to the maintenance and/or growth of the microorganism (e.g., carbon sources or carbon substrate, for example complex carbohydrates such as bean or grain meal, starches, sugars, sugar alcohols, hydrocarbons, oils, fats, fatty acids, organic acids and alcohols; nitrogen sources, for example, vegetable proteins, peptones, peptides and amino acids derived from grains, beans and tubers, proteins, peptides and amino acids derived form animal sources such as meat, milk and animal byproducts such as peptones, meat extracts and casein hydrolysates; inorganic nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate; phosphorus sources, for example, phosphoric acid, sodium and potassium salts thereof; trace elements, for example, magnesium, iron, manganese, calcium, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum, and/or cobalt salts; as well as growth factors such as amino acids, vitamins, growth promoters and the like). Preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled pH. The term ‚Äúcontrolled pH‚Äù includes any pH which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of about 7. In another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.5. The desired pH may be maintained by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art. Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled aeration. The term ‚Äúcontrolled aeration‚Äù includes sufficient aeration (e.g., oxygen) to result in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, aeration is controlled by regulating oxygen levels in the culture, for example, by regulating the amount of oxygen dissolved in culture media. Preferably, aeration of the culture is controlled by agitating the culture. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the growth vessel (e.g., fermentor) or by various pumping equipment. Aeration may be further controlled by the passage of sterile air or oxygen through the medium (e.g., through the fermentation mixture). Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured without excess foaming (e.g., via addition of antifoaming agents). Moreover, plants or microorganisms of the present invention can be cultured under controlled temperatures. The term ‚Äúcontrolled temperature‚Äù includes any temperature which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞ C. and 95¬∞ C. In another embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞ C. and 70¬∞ C. Preferred temperatures are between 20¬∞ C. and 55¬∞ C., more preferably between 30¬∞ C. and 45¬∞ C. or between 30¬∞ C. and 50¬∞ C. Microorganisms can be cultured (e.g., maintained and/or grown) in liquid media and preferably are cultured, either continuously or intermittently, by conventional culturing methods such as standing culture, test tube culture, shaking culture (e.g., rotary shaking culture, shake flask culture, etc.), aeration spinner culture, or fermentation. In a preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in shake flasks. In a more preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in a fermentor (e.g., a fermentation process). Fermentation processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, batch, fed-batch and continuous methods of fermentation. The phrase ‚Äúbatch process‚Äù or ‚Äúbatch fermentation‚Äù refers to a closed system in which the composition of media, nutrients, supplemental additives and the like is set at the beginning of the fermentation and not subject to alteration during the fermentation, however, attempts may be made to control such factors as pH and oxygen concentration to prevent excess media acidification and/or microorganism death. The phrase ‚Äúfed-batch process‚Äù or ‚Äúfed-batch‚Äù fermentation refers to a batch fermentation with the exception that one or more substrates or supplements are added (e.g., added in increments or continuously) as the fermentation progresses. The phrase ‚Äúcontinuous process‚Äù or ‚Äúcontinuous fermentation‚Äù refers to a system in which a defined fermentation media is added continuously to a fermentor and an equal amount of used or ‚Äúconditioned‚Äù media is simultaneously removed, preferably for recovery of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). A variety of such processes have been developed and are well-known in the art. The phrase ‚Äúculturing under conditions such that a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid, for example, DHA) is produced‚Äù includes maintaining and/or growing plants or microorganisms under conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, duration, etc.) appropriate or sufficient to obtain production of the desired compound or to obtain desired yields of the particular compound being produced. For example, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to produce the desired amount of a unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA). Preferably, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to substantially reach maximal production of the unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, culturing is continued for about 12 to 24 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for about 24 to 36 hours, 36 to 48 hours, 48 to 72 hours, 72 to 96 hours, 96 to 120 hours, 120 to 144 hours, or greater than 144 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to reach production yields of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, cells are cultured such that at least about 15 to 20 g/L of unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 20 to 25 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 25 to 30 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 30 to 35 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 35 to 40 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced (e.g., at least about 37 g/L unsaturated fatty acids) or at least about 40 to 50 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced. In yet another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured under conditions such that a preferred yield of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, a yield within a range set forth above, is produced in about 24 hours, in about 36 hours, in about 48 hours, in about 72 hours, or in about 96 hours. In producing unsaturated fatty acids, it may further be desirable to culture cells of the present invention in the presence of supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates. The term ‚Äúsupplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrate‚Äù includes an agent or compound which, when brought into contact with a cell or included in the culture medium of a cell, serves to enhance or increase unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added in the form of a concentrated solution or suspension (e.g., in a suitable solvent such as water or buffer) or in the form of a solid (e.g., in the form of a powder). Moreover, supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added as a single aliquot, continuously or intermittently over a given period of time. The methodology of the present invention can further include a step of recovering a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). The term ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù a desired compound includes extracting, harvesting, isolating or purifying the compound from culture media. Recovering the compound can be performed according to any conventional isolation or purification methodology known in the art including, but not limited to, treatment with a conventional resin (e.g., anion or cation exchange resin, non-ionic adsorption resin, etc.), treatment with a conventional adsorbent (e.g., activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina, etc.), alteration of pH, solvent extraction (e.g., with a conventional solvent such as an alcohol, ethyl acetate, hexane and the like), dialysis, filtration, concentration, crystallization, recrystallization, pH adjustment, lyophilization and the like. For example, a compound can be recovered from culture media by first removing the microorganisms from the culture. Media is then passed through or over a cation exchange resin to remove unwanted cations and then through or over an anion exchange resin to remove unwanted inorganic anions and organic acids having stronger acidities than the unsaturated fatty acid of interest (e.g., DHA). Preferably, a desired compound of the present invention is ‚Äúextracted,‚Äù ‚Äúisolated‚Äù or ‚Äúpurified‚Äù such that the resulting preparation is substantially free of other components (e.g., free of media components and/or fermentation byproducts). The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of other components‚Äù includes preparations of desired compound in which the compound is separated (e.g., purified or partially purified) from media components or fermentation byproducts of the culture from which it is produced. In one embodiment, the preparation has greater than about 80% (by dry weight) of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 20% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), more preferably greater than about 90% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 10% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), still more preferably greater than about 95% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 5% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), and most preferably greater than about 98-99% desired compound (e.g., less than about 1-2% other media components or fermentation byproducts). When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to a salt, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the salt. When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to an alcohol, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the alcohol. In an alternative embodiment, the desired unsaturated fatty acid is not purified from the plant or microorganism, for example, when the plant or microorganism is biologically non-hazardous (e.g., safe). For example, the entire plant or culture (or culture supernatant) can be used as a source of product (e.g., crude product). In one embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) supernatant is used without modification. In another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is concentrated. In yet another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is pulverized, dried, or lyophilized. B. High Yield Production Methodologies A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention is a high yield production method for producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., DHA, comprising culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that the unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a significantly high yield. The phrase ‚Äúhigh yield production method,‚Äù for example, a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) includes a method that results in production of the desired compound at a level which is elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods. Preferably, a high yield production method results in production of the desired compound at a significantly high yield. The phrase ‚Äúsignificantly high yield‚Äù includes a level of production or yield which is sufficiently elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods, for example, which is elevated to a level sufficient for commercial production of the desired product (e.g., production of the product at a commercially feasible cost). In one embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 2 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 10 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 20 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 40 g/L. The invention further features a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) that involves culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that a sufficiently elevated level of compound is produced within a commercially desirable period of time. In an exemplary embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 15-20 g/L in 36 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 25-30 g/L in 48 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 35-40 g/L in 72 hours, for example, greater that 37 g/L in 72 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30-40 g/L in 60 hours, for example, greater that 30, 35 or 40 g/L in 60 hours. Values and ranges included and/or intermediate within the ranges set forth herein are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention. For example, unsaturated fatty acid production at levels of at least 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 g/L in 60 hours are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. In another example, ranges of 30-35 g/L or 35-40 g/L are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. Moreover, the skilled artisan will appreciate that culturing a manipulated microorganism to achieve a production level of, for example, ‚Äú30-40 g/L in 60 hours‚Äù includes culturing the microorganism for additional time periods (e.g., time periods longer than 60 hours), optionally resulting in even higher yields of an unsaturated fatty acid being produced. IV. Compositions The desaturase nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and fragments thereof, of the invention can be used to produce unsaturated fatty acids which can be incorporated into compositions. Compositions of the present invention include, e.g., compositions for use as animal feed, compositions for use as neutraceuticals (e.g., dietary supplements), and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise an unsaturated fatty acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language ‚Äúpharmaceutically acceptable carrier‚Äù is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL‚Ñ¢ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a LCPUFA, or a fragment thereof, produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as pepper mint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with a LCPUFA in the range of between about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody, protein, or polypeptide used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent from the results of diagnostic assays as described herein. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the figures, are incorporated herein by reference. EXAMPLES Materials: Thraustochytrium s.p ATCC 21685 and Pythium irregulare were purchased from American type culture collection (12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., 20852 USA) and grown in a medium (Weete, J. D., et al. (1997) Lipids 32:839-845) at 24¬∞ C. for 7 days. After then biomass were harvested by centrifugation and used for RNA isolation. Example 1 Construction and Screening of cDNA Library Total RNA was isolated from the above materials according to Qiu and Erickson (Qiu, X. and Eriekson, L. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. Repr. 12:209-214). The cDNA library was constructed from the total RNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase from Gibco-BRL. The second strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I from Stratagene. After size fractionation, cDNA inserts larger than 1 kb were ligated into Œª Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene). The recombinantÀúDNAs were then packed with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) and plated on NZY plates. The resulting library represented more than 5√ó106 independent clones. Screening of the cDNA library was performed according to standard methods (Sambrook, J, Fritseh, E. F., Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular cloning‚ÄîA laboratory manual. (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA.) Example 2 RT-PCR The single strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) from total RNA and was then used as the template for PCR reaction with two degenerate primers (The forward primer: GCNCA/GANGANCAC/TCCNGGXGG (SEQ ID NO:9) and the reverse primer: ATNTG/TNGGA/GAANAG/AG/ATGG/ATG (SEQ ID NO:10)). The PCR amplification consisted of 35 cycles with 1 min at 94¬∞ C., 1.5 min at 55¬∞ C. and 2 min at 72¬∞ C. followed by an extension step at 72¬∞ C. for 10 min. The amplified products from 800 bp to 1000 bp were isolated from agarose gel and purified by a kit (Qiaex II gel purification, Qiagen), and subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR¬Æ2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were then sequenced by PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). Example 3 Expression of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 in Yeast The open reading frames of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 were amplified by PCR using the Precision Plus enzyme (Stratagene) and cloned into a TA cloning vector (pCR¬Æ 2.1, Invitrogen). Having confirmed that the PCR products were identical to the original cDNAs by sequencing, the fragments were then released by a BarnHI-EcoRI double digestion and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the inducible promoter GAL1. Yeast strains InvSc2 (Invitrogen) was transformed with the expression constructs using the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil (Gietz, D., et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20:1425; Covello, P. S. and Reed, D. W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226). Transformants were first grown in minimal medium lacking uracil and containing glucose at 28¬∞ C. After overnight culture, the cells were spun down, washed and resuspended in distilled water. Minimal medium containing 2% galactose, with or without 0.3 mM substrate fatty acids in the presence of 0.1% tergitol, was inoculated with the yeast transformant cell suspension and incubated at 20¬∞ C. for three days, and then 15¬∞ C. for another three days. Example 4 Fatty Acid Analysis Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare and yeast cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water. Then 2 mL methanolic KOH (7.5% w/v KOH in 95% methanol) was added to the materials and the mixture sealed in a 12 ml glass culture tube was heated to 80¬∞ C. for 2 hours 0.5 mL water was added and the sample was extracted twice with 2 mL hexane to remove the non-saponifiable lipids. The remaining aqueous phase was then acidified by adding 1 mL 6 N HCl and extracted twice with 2 mL hexane. The hexane phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. 2 mL 3 N methanolic HCl (SUPELCO, Supelco Park, Bellefonte, Pa. 16823-0048) was added and the mixture was heated at 80¬∞ C. for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL 0.9% NaCl was added and the mixture extracted twice with 2√ó2 mL hexane. The combined hexane was evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMES) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS according to Covello & Reed (Covello, P. S. and Reed, D. W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226). GC/MS analysis was performed in standard EI mode using a Fisons VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, UK) controlled by Masslynx version 2.0 software, coupled to a GC 8000 Series gas chromatograph. A DB-23 column (30M√ó0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 Ilm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, Calif.) that was temperature-programmed at 180¬∞ C. for 1 min, then 4 C/min to 240¬∞ C. and held for 15 minutes, was used for FAME analysis. Example 5 Transformation of Brassica Juncea and Flax (Linum Usitatissimum) and Exogenous Fatty Acid Treatment The hypocotyls of 5-6 day seedlings of B. juncea and flax were used as explants for inoculation with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens that hosts binary vectors with the full-length cDNAs under the control of the different promoters. The 20-day transgenic seedlings were used for exogenous fatty acid treatment. The seedling was divided into three parts: leaves, stems and roots. Each was cut into the small pieces and placed in a 24-well titer plate. To each well, 2 mL 0.05% sodium salt of substrates (NuCheck Prep Inc., Elysian, Minn.) was added. The plate was then incubated at 24¬∞ C. for 4 h with gentle shaking. After incubation, the plant tissues were washed three times with water and then used for fatty acid analysis. Example 6 Fatty Acid Profile of the Thrauschytrium Sp. Thraustochytrium and Pythium irregulare have recently drawn scientific attention due to its ability in production of LCPUFAs such as DHA, AA, EPA and DPA. FIGS. 23 and 24 show the fatty acid composition of the lipids isolated from 7 day cultures of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , respectively. As shown in the tables, the microorganisms contain a broad range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from both n-3 and n-6 families, from 18-carbon A6 fatty acids (gamma-linolenic acid and steardonic acid) to 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids (DHA and DPA). The organisms, especially Thraustochytrium sp., appear to contain a full-set of desaturation and elongation enzymes required for the DHA and DPA biosynthesis. The strain lacks 24-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, the proposed precursors for DHA and DPA synthesis in Precher's pathway (Voss, A., et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:19995-20000; Mohammed, B. S., et al. (1997) Biochem. J. 326:425-430). The 24-carbon fatty acid may not be involved in in vivo synthesis of 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids such as DHA and DPA in Thraustochytrium sp. Example 7 Identification of cDNAs Coding for the ‚ÄúFront-End‚Äù Desaturase To identify genes coding for desaturases involved in biosynthesis of LCFUFAs in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , a PCR-based cloning strategy was adopted. Two degenerate primers are designed to target the heme-binding motif of N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in front-end desaturases and the third conservative histidine motif in all microsomal desaturases, respectively. The rational behind the design is that the desaturases involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , should have similar primary structure as other front-end desaturases, i.e. N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in the desaturase. Four cDNAs fragments were identified from Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare that encode fusion proteins containing cyt b5-like domain in the N-terminus. To isolate full-length cDNA clones, the four inserts were used as probes to screen cDNA libraries of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , which resulted in identification of several cDNA clones in each group. Sequencing of all those clones identified four full-length cDNAs which were named as Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2 and Fad6. The open reading frame of Fad4 is 1560 bp and codes for 519 amino acids with molecular weight of 59.1 kDa ( FIG. 1 ). Fad5 is 1230 bp in length and codes for 439 amino acids with molecular weight of 49.8 kDa ( FIG. 2 ). A sequence comparison of these two sequences from Thraustochytrium sp. showed only 16% amino acid identity between the deduced proteins. A detailed analysis revealed that Fad4 is 80 amino acids longer than Fad5, occurring between the second and third conservative histidine motifs ( FIG. 3 ). The open reading frame of Fad5-2 from Pythium irregulare is 1371 bp and codes for 456 amino acids ( FIG. 4 ). Fad6 from Pythium irregulare is 1383 bp in length and codes for 460 amino acids ( FIG. 5 ). Sequence comparison of the two sequences from Pythium irregulare showed over 39% similarity between the deduced proteins ( FIG. 6 ). A BLASTP‚Ñ¢ search of the protein database revealed the following hits for each of the four proteins, Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6: Fad 4 (519 Amino Acid Residues) Blastp nrAccessionNo.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF067654Mortierella alpinaŒî5 fatty acid50929desaturaseAF054824Mortierella alpinaŒî5 microsomal50928desaturaseAB022097DictyosteliumŒî5 fatty acid50727discoideumdesaturaseAB029311Dictyosteliumfatty acid51926discoideumdesaturaseL11421Synechocystis sp.Œî6 desaturase41025D90914 Fad 5 (439 Amino Acid Residues) Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF139720Euglena gracilisŒî8 fatty acid40429desaturaseAF007561Borago officinalisŒî6 desaturase42127U79010Borago officinalisŒî6 desaturase42127AF309556Danio rerioŒî6 fatty acid42226desaturaseAF110510MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid46325alpinadesaturase Fad 5-2 (456 Amino Acid Residues) Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAB029311DictosteliumFatty acid44341discoideumdesaturaseAB022097DictosteliumŒî5 fatty acid44539discoideumdesaturaseAF067654MortierellaŒî5 fatty acid44138alpinadesaturaseAF054824MortierellaŒî5 microsomal44138alpinadesaturaseL11421Synechocystis sp.Œî6 desaturase36128D90914 Fad 6 (459 Amino Acid Residues) Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF110510MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43738alpinadesaturaseAB020032MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43738alpinadesaturaseAF306634MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43738isabellinadesaturaseAF307940MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43838alpinadesaturaseAJ250735CeratodonŒî6 fatty acid43836purpureusdesaturase Example 8 Expression of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 in Yeast To confirm the function of Fad4, the full-length cDNA was expressed in the yeast strain InvSc2 under the control of the inducible promoter. FIG. 7 shows that with supplementation of the medium with 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19), yeast cells containing Fad4 cDNA had an extra fatty acid as compared to the vector control. The peak has a retention time identical to the DHA standard. LC/MS analysis of the free fatty acid showed that it yields deprotonated molecular ions (m/z=279) identical to the DHA standard in negative ion electrospray. Moreover, GC/MS analysis of the FAME confirmed that the spectrum of the peak is identical to that of the DHA standard ( FIG. 8 ). These results indicate that Fad4 is a Œî4 fatty acid desaturase which is able to introduce a double bond at position 4 of the 22:5(7,10,13,16,19) substrate, resulting in a Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DHA (22:6-4,7,10,13,16,19). To further study the substrate specificity of the Fad4, a number of substrates including 18:2(9,12), 18:3(9,12,15), 20:3(8,11,14) and 22:4(7,10,13,16) were separately supplied to the yeast transformants. The results indicated Fad4 could also use 22:4 (7,10,13,16) as a substrate ( FIG. 9 ) to produce another Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DPA (22:5-4,7,10,13,16) ( FIG. 10 ). The rest of the fatty acids examined were not effective substrates. To confirm the function of Fad5 and Fad5-2, the S. cerevisiae Invsc2 was transformed with plasmids, which contain the open reading frame of the Fad5 and Fad5-2 respectively under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter. When the yeast transformants were induced by galactose in a medium containing homo-gamma-linolenic acid (HGLA, 20:3-8, 11,14), an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 11 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the fatty acid had a retention time identical to the arachidonic acid standard (AA, 20:4-5,8,11,14). To further confirm the regiochemistry of the products, the FAMEs were analyzed by GC/MS. FIG. 12 indicates that the mass spectra of the new fatty acid and the AA standard are identical. These results demonstrate that Fad5 and Fad5-2 convert HGLA (20:3-8, 11,13) into AA (20:4-5,8,11,14) in yeast. To further study the substrate specificity of Fad5-2, the plasmid containing Fad5-2 was transferred into another yeast strain AMY-2Œ± where ole1, a Œî9 desaturase gene, is disrupted. The strain is unable to grow in minimal media without supplementation with mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In this experiment, the strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 17:1(10Z), a non-substrate of Fad5-2, which enabled study of the specificity of the enzyme towards various substrates, especially monounsaturates. A number of possible substrates including 16:1(9Z), 18:1(9Z), 18:1(11Z), 18:1(11E), 18:1(12E), 18:1(15Z), 18:2(9Z,12Z), 18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z), 20:2(11Z,14Z) and 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) were tested. Results indicated that Fad5-2 could desaturate unsaturated fatty acids with Œî9 ethylenic and Œî11 ethylenic double bonds, as well as the fatty acid with Œî8 ethylenic double bond (20:3-8, 11,14). As shown in FIG. 13 , Fad5-2 effectively converted both 18:1(9Z) and 18:1(11Z) substrates into their corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids, 18:2-5, 9 (the retention time 10.34 min) and 18:1-5, 11 (the retention time 10.44 min), respectively. Fad5-2 also desaturated trans fatty acid such as 18:1(11E) and 18:1(12E). FIG. 25 is a comparison of substrate preference of Fad5-2 for fatty acid substrates tested in the yeast strain AMY-2Œ±. The relative proportions of the substrates and the products accumulated are a useful indicator of substrate preference of the enzyme. As shown in FIG. 25 , Fad5-2 prefers fatty acids with 20-carbon as substrates, such as 20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z), 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) and 20:2(11Z,14Z). Whereas, the shorter chain fatty acid is a relatively weaker substrate for the enzyme in yeast. To confirm the function of Fad6, the S. cerevisiae host strain Invsc2 was transformed with a plasmid containing the open reading frame of Fad6 under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter, GAL1. When the yeast transformant was induced by galactose in a medium containing linoleic acid, an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of the FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 14 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the peak had a retention time identical to the gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3-6, 9,12) standard. To confirm the regioselectivity of the products, the diethylamine derivatives of fatty acids from the expressing strain were analyzed by GC-MS. FIG. 15 shows that the new peak is indeed GLA with three double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions. Major fragments of n and n+1 carbons differing by 12 D are diagnostic of a double bond between carbon n+1 and n+2. Thus, the fragments at 156 and 168, 196 and 208, and 236 and 248, indicate double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions, respectively. These results demonstrate that Fad6 is a Œî6 desaturate that converts linoleic acid (18:2) to GLA in yeast. Example 9 Expression of Fad4 in B. Juncea To determine whether Traustochytrium Fad4 is functional in oilseed crops, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad4 under the control of a constitutive promoter. Eight independent transgenic plants were obtained. In B. juncea there is no Œî4 fatty acid desaturase substrates available. Thus, to examine the activity of the transgenic enzyme in the plants, the 22:5 (n-3) substrate must be exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium docosapentaeneate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of both types of plants, but converted into DHA only in transgenics. Leaves have a higher level of production of DHA than roots and stems. In leaves, the exogenous substrate was incorporated to a level of 10-20% of the total fatty acids and Œî4 desaturated fatty acid (22:6, n-3) was produced in a range of 3-6% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 16 ). These results indicate that the Œî4 fatty acid desaturase from Traustochytrium is functional in oilseed crops. Example 10 Expression of Fad5-2 in B. Juncea To determine whether Fad5-2 is functional in oilseed crops and its expression has any effect on their growth and development, B. juncea were transformed with a binary vector that contained Fad5-2 cDNA behind a constitutive promoter (a tandem cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter). Six independent primary transgenic plants were obtained and the fatty acid profile of lipids from different tissues was determined. FIG. 17 shows the fatty acid composition of three-week-old seedling plants from one T 1 line. Compared with wild type, all transgenic plant tissues have an altered fatty acid profile containing four additional peaks which were identified as four different Œî5-undesaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids (Œî5-UPIFAs), specifically, taxoleic (18:2-5, 9); ephedrenic (18:2-5, 11); pinolenic (18:3-5, 9,12), and coniferonic acids (18:4-5,9,12,15). Thus B. juncea , like yeast, can functionally express the P. irregulare Œî5 desaturase to convert the endogenous substrates 18:1-9; 18:1-11; 18:2-9, 12, and 18:3-9, 12,15 to the corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids. The roots produced the highest amount of the Œî5-UPIFAs, representing more than 20% of the total fatty acids, followed by 6% in stems and 5% in leaves ( FIG. 17 ). In B. juncea there is no homo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3-8, 11,14) substrate available. Thus, to examine whether the transgenic plant can produce AA, the substrate 20:3(8,11,14) was exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium homo-gamma-linolenate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of transgenic plants and converted into AA in plants ( FIG. 18 ). There was no observable phenotypic effect on the growth and development in the transgenic B. juncea , although the Œî5-UPIFAs accumulated in all parts of the plant. Growth and differentiation of vegetative tissues such as the leaves, stems, and roots were indistinguishable from the corresponding wild type. To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in seeds, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad5-2 cDNA behind a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Fatty acid analysis of transgenic seeds showed that there were two new fatty acids appearing in the gas chromatogram of transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 19 ). They were identified as taxoleic acid (18:2-5, 9) and pinolenic acids (18:3-5, 9,12). Together, these fatty acids represent 9.4% of the seed fatty acids. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs has no significant effect on the oleic acid content compared with the untransformed control. Example 11 Expression of Fad5-2 in Flax To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, flax was transformed with Fad5-2 under the control of two seed-specific promoters, a heterologous B. napus napin promoter, and a flax endogenous promoter. As shown in FIG. 26 , transgenic plants containing the napin promoter produced one Œî5 desaturated fatty acid, taxoleic acid in seeds at the level of less than 1% of the total fatty acids. Whereas transgenic plants containing the flax seed-specific promoter produced three Œî5 desaturated fatty acids: taxoleic, pinolenic, and coniferonic acid. Of these, taxoleic (18:2-5, 9) was the most abundant and accounted for more than 9% of the total fatty acids in a elite line (FN-10-1), followed by coniferonic and pinolenic acids. Surprisingly, accumulation of Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in transgenic seeds has significant impact on the composition of other fatty acids, especially the oleic acid level. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs was accompanied by a huge increase of the oleic acids in both types of transgenic plants expressing Fad5-2 desaturase under the control of the different promoters. The content of oleic acid in transgenic plants with the napin and flax seed-specific promoters, on the average, reached 44.7% and 24.3% of the total fatty acids, respectively, relative to the untransformed control at 17.4%. Example 12 Expression of Fad6 in Flax To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, two types of flax were transformed with the construct that contains Fad6 cDNA under the control of a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Type I flax (Normandy) is a traditional industrial oilseed crop, whereas Type II (Solin) is an edible oilseed crop derived from chemical mutagenesis of Type I. A total of twelve transgenic plants were produced. The majority of transgenics exhibited two novel fatty acids whose retention times correspond to GLA and SDA and they constitute 0.1 to 4.3% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 27 ). The level of GLA in transgenic Solin type is higher than that of SDA, while GLA in transgenic Normandy is lower than SDA. This is understandable because linoleic acid is a major fatty acid in Solin type linseed while Œ±-linolenic acid is a major fatty acid in Normandy seeds. Example 13 Expression of Fad6 in B. Juncea To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in seeds of B. juncea, B. juncea were transformed with the same construct used in flax transformation, i.e., Fad6 under the control of the B. napus napin promoter. Fifteen independent transgenic plants were obtained. Fatty acid analysis of the transgenic seeds showed that there were three new fatty acids in the gas chromatogram of most transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 20 ). The three fatty acids were identified as 18:2(6,9) and 18:3(6,9,12), and 18:4(6,9,12,15). B. juncea , like flax, can also functionally express Fad6 from P. irregulare , introducing a double bond at position 6 of endogenous substrate 18:1(9), 18:2(9,12), and 18:3(6,9,12) resulting in production of three corresponding Œî6 fatty acids in the transgenic seeds. Among the three new fatty acids produced in transgenic seeds, GLA is the most abundant one, with a level in transgenic seeds of 30% to 38% of the total fatty acids. The next most abundant component is SDA, which accounts for 3-10% of the total fatty acids in several transgenic lines ( FIG. 21 ). The fatty acid compositions of transgenic seeds are shown in FIG. 22 . It is clear that the high level production of Œî6 desaturated fatty acids is at the cost of two major fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acids. Proportions of oleic and stearic acids in transgenics are slightly reduced, but not significantly compared to those in the wild type control. The content of linoleic acid in the transgenics was dramatically reduced. In the untransformed wild type, linoleic acid accounts for more than 40% of the total fatty acids in seeds. In transgenics, the level was reduced to less than 10%. As compared to the reduction of linoleic acid in transgenics, the decrease in linolenic acid in transgenics is less dramatic, but still significant. In the untransformed wild type, linolenic acid accounts for more than 10% of the total fatty acids in seeds while in transgenics the level was reduced to less than 5%. The two dramatically reduced fatty acids in transgenic seeds are the substrates of the Œî6 desaturase, and the reduction is the cost for producing two corresponding Œî6 desaturated fatty acids.

The entire contents of all references cited therein also are expressly incorporated by reference and are intended to be part of the present application. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fatty acids are carboxylic acids with long-chain hydrocarbon side groups and play a fundamental role in many biological processes. Fatty acids are rarely free in nature but, rather, occur in esterified form as the major component of lipids. Lipids/fatty acids are sources of energy (e.g., b-oxidation) and are an integral part of cell membranes which are indispensable for processing biological or biochemical information. Fatty acids can be divided into two groups: the saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids which contain one or more carbon double bond in cis-configuration. Unsaturated fatty acids are produced by terminal desaturases that belong to the class of nonheme-iron enzymes. Each of these enzymes are part of a electron-transport system that contains two other proteins, namely cytochrome b 5 and NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. Human and other mammals have a limited spectrum of these desaturases that are required for the formation of particular double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, humans have to take up some fatty acids through their diet. Such essential fatty acids, for example, are linoleic acid (C18:2); linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4). In contrast, insects and plants are able to synthesize a much larger variety of unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)) are essential components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). For example, over 30% of fatty acids in brain phospholipid are 22:6 (n-3) and 20:4 (n-6). (Crawford, M. A., et al., (1997) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66:1032S-1041S). In retina, DHA accounts for more than 60% of the total fatty acids in the rod outer segment, the photosensitive part of the photoreceptor cell. (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has significant effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, some positive effects of DHA were also found on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Therefore, the appropriate dietary supply of the fatty acid is important for humans to remain healthy. It is particularly important for infant, young children and senior citizens to adequately intake these fatty acids from the diet since they cannot be efficiently synthesized in their body and must be supplemented by food (Spector, A. A. (1999) Lipids 34:S1-S3). DHA is a fatty acid of the n-3 series according to the location of the last double bond in the methyl end. It is synthesized via alternating steps of desaturation and elongation. Starting with 18:3 (9,12,15), biosynthesis of DHA involves Œî6 desaturation to 18:4 (6,9,12,15), followed by elongation to 20:4 (8,11,14,17) and Œî5 desaturation to 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17). Beyond this point, there are some controversies about the biosynthesis. The conventional view is that 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17) is elongated to 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19) and then converted to 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19) by the final Œî4 desaturation (Horrobin, D. F. (1992) Prog. Lipid Res. 31:163-194). However, Sprecher et al. recently suggested an alternative pathway for DHA biosynthesis, which is independent of Œî4 desaturase, involving two consecutive elongations, a Œî6 desaturation and a two-carbon shortening via limited Œ≤-oxidation in peroxisome (Sprecher, H., et al. (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36:2471-2477; Sprecher, H., et al. (1999) Lipids 34:S153-S156). Production of DHA is important because of its beneficial effect on human health. Currently the major sources of DHA are oils from fish and algae. Fish oil is a major and traditional source for this fatty acid, however, it is usually oxidized by the time it is sold. In addition, the supply of the oil is highly variable and its source is in jeopardy with the shrinking fish populations while the algal source is expensive due to low yield and the high costs of extraction. EPA and AA are both Œî5 essential fatty acids. They form a unique class of food and feed constituents for humans and animals. EPA belongs to the n-3 series with five double bonds in the acyl chain, is found in marine food, and is abundant in oily fish from North Atlantic. AA belongs to the n-6 series with four double bonds. The lack of a double bond in the œâ-3 position confers on AA different properties than those found in EPA. The eicosanoids produced from AA have strong inflammatory and platelet aggregating properties, whereas those derived from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet aggregating properties. AA can be obtained from some foods such as meat, fish, and eggs, but the concentration is low. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is another essential fatty acid found in mammals. GLA is the metabolic intermediate for very long chain n-6 fatty acids and for various active molecules. In mammals, formation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is rate-limited by Œî6 desaturation. Many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, stress, diabetes, eczema, and some infections have been shown to depress the Œî6 desaturation step. In addition, GLA is readily catabolized from the oxidation and rapid cell division associated with certain disorders, e.g., cancer or inflammation. Therefore, dietary supplementation with GLA can reduce the risks of these disorders. Clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation with GLA is effective in treating some pathological conditions such as atopic eczema, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders. The predominant sources of GLA are oils from plants such as evening primrose ( Oenothera biennis ), borage ( Borago officinalis L.), black currant ( Ribes nigrum ), and from microorganisms such as Mortierella sp., Mucor sp., and Cyanobacteria . However, these GLA sources are not ideal for dietary supplementation due to large fluctuations in availability and costs associated with extraction processes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The biosynthesis of fatty acids is a major activity of plants and microorganisms. However, humans have a limited capacity for synthesizing essential fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Biotechnology has long been considered an efficient way to manipulate the process of producing fatty acids in plants and microorganisms. It is cost-effective and renewable with little side effects. Thus, tremendous industrial effort directed to the production of various compounds including speciality fatty acids and pharmaceutical polypeptides through the manipulation of plant, animal, and microorganismal cells has ensued. Accordingly, biotechnology is an attractive route for producing unsaturated fatty acids, especially LCPUFAs, in a safe, cost-efficient manner so as to garner the maximum therapeutic value from these fatty acids. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a family of nucleic acid molecules encoding novel desaturases. In particular, the present inventors have identified the Fad 4 (Œî4 desaturase), Fad5 and Fad5-2 (Œî5 desaturase), and Fad6 (Œî6 desaturase) which are involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6, n-3) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5, n-6); more specifically, Fad4 desaturases 22:5 (n-3) and 22:4 (n-6) resulting in DHA and DPA; Fad5 and Fad5-2 desaturases 20:4 (n-3) and 20:3(n-6) resulting in EPA and AA; and Fad6 desaturases 18:2 (n-6) and 18:3(n-3) resulting in GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) and SDA (stearidonic acid).

In still other embodiments, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules including nucleotide sequences that are substantially identical (e.g., 70% identical) to the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7. The invention further features isolated nucleic acid molecules including at least 30 contiguous nucleotides of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7.

In a preferred embodiment, the desaturase polypeptide, or fragment thereof, has about three histidine motifs. The constructs containing the desaturase genes can be used in any expression system including plants, animals, and microorganisms for the production of cells capable of producing LCPUFAs such as DHA, EPA, AA, SDA, and GLA.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of novel fatty acid desaturase family members, referred to interchangeably herein as ‚Äúdesaturases‚Äù or ‚Äúdesaturase‚Äù nucleic acid and protein molecules (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6). These novel molecules are members of the fatty acid desaturase family and are expressed in LCPUFAs-producing organisms, e.g., Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare, Schizichytrium , and Crythecodinium. As used herein, the term ‚Äúfatty acids‚Äù is art recognized and includes a long-chain hydrocarbon based carboxylic acid. Fatty acids are components of many lipids including glycerides. The most common naturally occurring fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids which have an even number of carbon atoms (16 or 18) and which may be saturated or unsaturated. ‚ÄúUnsaturated‚Äù fatty acids contain cis double bonds between the carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids encompassed by the present invention include, for example, DHA, GLA, and SDA. ‚ÄúPolyunsaturated‚Äù fatty acids contain more than one double bond and the double bonds are arranged in a methylene interrupted system (‚ÄîCH‚ïêCH‚ÄîCH 2 ‚ÄîCH‚ïêCH‚Äî). Fatty acids are described herein by a numbering system in which the number before the colon indicates the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, whereas the number after the colon is the number of double bonds that are present. In the case of unsaturated fatty acids, this is followed by a number in parentheses that indicates the position of the double bonds. Each number in parenthesis is the lower numbered carbon atom of the two connected by the double bond. For example, oleic acid can be described as 18:1(9) and linoleic acid can be described as 18:2(9, 12) indicating 18 carbons, one double bond at carbon 9, two double bonds at carbons 9 and 12, respectively. The controlling steps in the production of unsaturated fatty acids, i.e., the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, are catalyzed by membrane-associated fatty acid desaturases, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. As used herein, the term ‚Äúunsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway‚Äù refers to a series of chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of an unsaturated fatty acid either in vivo or in vitro. Such a pathway includes a series of desaturation and elongation steps which generate unsaturated fatty acids and ultimately, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Such unsaturated fatty acids can include, GLA 18:3 (6,9,12), SDA 18:4 (6,9,12,15), AA 20:4 (5,8,11,14), EPA 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17), and DPA 22:5 (4,7,10,13,16), and DHA 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19). Desaturases can contain a heme-binding motif and/or about three conservative histidine motifs, although additional domains may be present. Members of the fatty acid desaturase family convert saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), which are components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). Examples of LCPUFA include, among others, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, positive effects of DHA were also found in the treatment of diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Thus, the desaturase molecules can be used to produce the LCPUFAs useful in treating disorders characterized by aberrantly regulated growth, proliferation, or differentiation. Such disorders include cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, or leukemia; tumor angiogenesis and metastasis; skeletal dysplasia; hepatic disorders; myelodysplastic syndromes; and hematopoietic and/or myeloproliferative disorders. Other disorders related to angiogenesis and which are, therefore, desaturase associated disorders include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. The term ‚Äúfamily‚Äù when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention is intended to mean two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin or alternatively, can contain homologues of non-human origin, e.g., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. For example, the family of desaturase proteins of the present invention comprises one cytochrome b5 heme-binding motif. As used herein, the term ‚Äúheme-binding motif‚Äù is an N-terminal extension of the cytochrome b5-like domain found in front-end desaturases. In another embodiment, members of the desaturase family of proteins include a ‚Äúhistidine motifs‚Äù in the protein, preferably, about three or four histidine motifs. As used herein, the term ‚Äúhistidine motif‚Äù includes a protein domain having at least about two histidine amino acid residues, preferably about three or four histidine amino acid residues, and is typically found in all microsomal desaturases as the third conservative histidine motif. Examples of cytochrome b5 heme-binding motifs and histidine motifs include amino acid residues 41-44, 182-186, 216-223, and 453-462 of SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 40-43, 171-175, 207-213, and 375-384 of SEQ ID NO:4, amino acid residues 40-45, 171-176, 208-213, and 395-400 of SEQ ID NO:6, and amino acid residues 42-47, 178-183, 215-220, and 400-405 of SEQ ID NO:8, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 6 . Isolated desaturase proteins of the present invention have an amino acid sequence sufficiently homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 or are encoded by a nucleotide sequence sufficiently homologous to SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5 or 7. As used herein, the term ‚Äúsufficiently homologous‚Äù refers to a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence which contains a sufficient or minimum number of identical or equivalent (e.g., an amino acid residue which has a similar side chain) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleotide sequences share common structural domains or motifs and/or a common functional activity. For example, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share common structural domains having at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity across the amino acid sequences of the domains and contain at least one and preferably two structural domains or motifs, are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. Furthermore, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity and share a common functional activity are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains or motifs: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif and has an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous or identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif, and is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one heme-binding motif and/or at least about three histidine motifs, and has a desaturase activity. As used interchangeably herein, a ‚Äúdesaturase activity,‚Äù ‚Äúbiological activity of a desaturase,‚Äù or ‚Äúfunctional activity of a desaturase,‚Äù includes an activity exerted or mediated by a desaturase protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on a desaturase responsive cell or on a desaturase substrate, as determined in vivo or in vitro, according to standard techniques. In one embodiment, a desaturase activity is a direct activity such as an association with a desaturase target molecule. As used herein, a ‚Äútarget molecule‚Äù or ‚Äúbinding partner‚Äù is a molecule e.g., a molecule involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, with which a desaturase protein binds or interacts in nature such that a desaturase-mediated function is achieved. A desaturase direct activity also includes the formation of a double bond between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule to form an unsaturated fatty acid molecule. The nucleotide sequence of the isolated Thraustochytrium sp. A4 desaturase, Fad4, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad4 cDNA are shown in FIG. 1 and in SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad4 gene (the open reading frame), which is approximately 1560 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 59.1 kD and which is approximately 519 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Thraustochytrium sp. A5 desaturase, Fad5, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5 cDNA are shown in FIG. 2 and in SEQ ID NOs:3 and 4, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad5 gene, which is approximately 1320 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 49.8 kD and which is approximately 439 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî5 desaturase, Fad5-2, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5-2 cDNA are shown in FIG. 4 and in SEQ ID NOs:5 and 6, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad5-2 gene, which is approximately 1371 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 456 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî6 desaturase, Fad6, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad6 cDNA are shown in FIG. 5 and in SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad6 gene, which is approximately 1383 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 460 amino acid residues in length. Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections: I. Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode desaturase proteins or biologically active portions thereof, as well as nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify desaturase-encoding nucleic acid molecules (e.g., desaturase mRNA) and fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of desaturase nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term ‚Äúnucleic acid molecule‚Äù is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. The term ‚Äúisolated nucleic acid molecule‚Äù includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term ‚Äúisolated‚Äù includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an ‚Äúisolated‚Äù nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated desaturase nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an ‚Äúisolated‚Äù nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, e.g., a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, or a portion thereof, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information provided herein. Using all or a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, as hybridization probes, desaturase nucleic acid molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook, J. et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd , ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule encompassing all or a portion of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, can be isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed based upon the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. A nucleic acid of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to desaturase nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule consists of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a portion of any of these nucleotide sequences. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 is one which is sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that it can hybridize to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby forming a stable duplex. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 (e.g., to the entire length of the nucleotide sequence), or a portion or complement of any of these nucleotide sequences. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least (or no greater than) 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-750, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. Moreover, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, a fragment which can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding a portion of a desaturase protein, e.g., a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein. The nucleotide sequence determined from the cloning of the desaturase gene allows for the generation of probes and primers designed for use in identifying and/or cloning other desaturase family members, as well as desaturase homologues from other species. The probe/primer (e.g., oligonucleotide) typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 12 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 75 consecutive nucleotides of a sense sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5 or 7, of an anti-sense sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or of a naturally occurring allelic variant or mutant of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. Exemplary probes or primers are at least (or no greater than) 12 or 15, 20 or 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or more nucleotides in length and/or comprise consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein. Also included within the scope of the present invention are probes or primers comprising contiguous or consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein, but for the difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases within the probe or primer sequence. Probes based on the desaturase nucleotide sequences can be used to detect (e.g., specifically detect) transcripts or genomic sequences encoding the same or homologous proteins. In preferred embodiments, the probe further comprises a label group attached thereto, e.g., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. In another embodiment a set of primers is provided, e.g., primers suitable for use in a PCR, which can be used to amplify a selected region of a desaturase sequence, e.g., a domain, region, site or other sequence described herein. The primers should be at least 5, 10, or 50 base pairs in length and less than 100, or less than 200, base pairs in length. The primers should be identical, or differ by no greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases when compared to a sequence disclosed herein or to the sequence of a naturally occurring variant. Such probes can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissue which misexpress a desaturase protein, such as by measuring a level of a desaturase-encoding nucleic acid in a sample of cells from a subject, e.g., detecting desaturase mRNA levels or determining whether a genomic desaturase gene has been mutated or deleted. A nucleic acid fragment encoding a ‚Äúbiologically active portion of a desaturase protein‚Äù can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, which encodes a polypeptide having a desaturase biological activity (the biological activities of the desaturase proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the desaturase protein (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro) and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the desaturase protein. In an exemplary embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and encodes a protein having a desaturase activity (as described herein). The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same desaturase proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs by at least 1, but no greater than 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 amino acid residues from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the amino acid sequence of human desaturase. If an alignment is needed for this comparison, the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. Nucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologues (different locus), and orthologues (different organism) or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product). Allelic variants result, for example, from DNA sequence polymorphisms within a population (e.g., the human population) that lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the desaturase proteins. Such genetic polymorphism in the desaturase genes may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. As used herein, the terms ‚Äúgene‚Äù and ‚Äúrecombinant gene‚Äù refer to nucleic acid molecules which include an open reading frame encoding a desaturase protein, e.g., oilseed desaturase protein, and can further include non-coding regulatory sequences, and introns. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a naturally occurring allelic variant of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, wherein the nucleic acid molecule hybridizes to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions. Allelic variants of desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, include both functional and non-functional desaturase proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein that maintain the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., a fatty acid, e.g., 22:5(n-3)); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. The fatty acids produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention are also useful in treating disorders such as aging, stress, diabetes, cancer, inflammatory disorders (e.g., arthritis, eczema), and cardiovascular disorders. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only a conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Non-functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, that do not have the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, such as 18:4(6,9,12,15)); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. The present invention further provides orthologues (e.g., human orthologues of the desaturase proteins). Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins are proteins that are isolated from other organisms and possess the same desaturase substrate or target molecule binding mechanisms, double bond forming mechanisms, modulating mechanisms of growth and development of the brain in infants, maintenance mechanisms of normal brain function in adults, ability to affect photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, ability to affect rhodopsin activation, development mechanisms of rods and/or cones, and/or modulating mechanisms of cellular growth and/or proliferation of the non-human desaturase proteins. Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins can readily be identified as comprising an amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other desaturase family members and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, another desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins from different species, and which, thus, have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, Schizochytrium or Crythecodinium desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the desaturase cDNAs of the invention can be isolated based on their homology to the desaturase nucleic acids disclosed herein using the cDNAs disclosed herein, or a portion thereof, as a hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent hybridization conditions. Orthologues, homologues and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art (e.g., by hybridization to an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions). In one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention is at least 15, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In other embodiment, the nucleic acid is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length. As used herein, the term ‚Äúhybridizes under stringent conditions‚Äù is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences that are significantly identical or homologous to each other remain hybridized to each other. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% identical to each other remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1995), sections 2, 4, and 6. Additional stringent conditions can be found in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual , Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), chapters 7, 9, and 11. A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4√ó sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 4√ó SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 1√ó SSC, at about 65-70¬∞ C. A preferred, non-limiting example of highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 1√ó SSC, at about 65-70¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 1√ó SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 0.3√ó SSC, at about 65-70¬∞ C. A preferred, non-limiting example of reduced stringency hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4√ó SSC, at about 50-60¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 6√ó SSC plus 50% formamide at about 40-45¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 2√ó SSC, at about 50-60¬∞ C. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values, e.g., at 65-70¬∞ C. or at 42-50¬∞ C. are also intended to be encompassed by the present invention. SSPE (1√ó SSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1√ó SSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-10¬∞ C. less than the melting temperature (T m ) of the hybrid, where T m is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞ C.)=2(# of A+T bases)+4(# of G+C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞ C.)=81.5+16.6(log 10 [Na + ])+0.41(% G+C)‚àí(600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na + ] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer ([Na + ] for 1√ó SSC=0.165 M). It will also be recognized by the skilled practitioner that additional reagents may be added to hybridization and/or wash buffers to decrease non-specific hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to membranes, for example, nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, including but not limited to blocking agents (e.g., BSA or salmon or herring sperm carrier DNA), detergents (e.g., SDS), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA), Ficoll, PVP and the like. When using nylon membranes, in particular, an additional preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 0.25-0.5M NaH 2 PO 4 , 7% SDS at about 65¬∞ C., followed by one or more washes at 0.02M NaH 2 PO 4 , 1% SDS at 65¬∞ C. (see e.g., Church and Gilbert (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1991-1995), or alternatively 0.2√ó SSC, 1% SDS. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a ‚Äúnaturally-occurring‚Äù nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature (e.g., encodes a natural protein). In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of the desaturase sequences that may exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by mutation into the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded desaturase proteins, without altering the functional ability of the desaturase proteins. For example, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù amino acid residues can be made in the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 (e.g., the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8) without altering the biological activity, whereas an ‚Äúessential‚Äù amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the desaturase proteins of the present invention, e.g., those present in a heme-binding motif or a histidine motif, are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. Furthermore, additional amino acid residues that are conserved between the desaturase proteins of the present invention and other members of the fatty acid desaturase family are not likely to be amenable to alteration. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such desaturase proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, yet retain biological activity. In one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, wherein the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% 99% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, e.g., to the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a desaturase protein homologous to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A ‚Äúconservative amino acid substitution‚Äù is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a desaturase protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a desaturase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for desaturase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. In a preferred embodiment, a mutant desaturase protein can be assayed for the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. II. Isolated Desaturase Proteins One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated or recombinant desaturase proteins and polypeptides, and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment, native desaturase proteins can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, desaturase proteins are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a desaturase protein or polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. An ‚Äúisolated‚Äù or ‚Äúpurified‚Äù protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the desaturase protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of cellular material‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language ‚Äúsubstantially free of cellular material‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, or 30% (by dry weight) of non-desaturase protein (also referred to herein as a ‚Äúcontaminating protein‚Äù), more preferably less than about 20% of non-desaturase protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-desaturase protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-desaturase protein. When the desaturase protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language ‚Äúsubstantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals. It should be understood that the proteins or this invention can also be in a form which is different than their corresponding naturally occurring proteins and/or which is still in association with at least some cellular components. For example, the protein can be associated with a cellular membrane. As used herein, a ‚Äúbiologically active portion‚Äù of a desaturase protein includes a fragment of a desaturase protein which participates in an interaction between a desaturase molecule and a non-desaturase molecule (e.g., a desaturase substrate such as fatty acid). Biologically active portions of a desaturase protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the desaturase amino acid sequences, e.g., the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 which include sufficient amino acid residues to exhibit at least one activity of a desaturase protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the desaturase protein; the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. A biologically active portion of a desaturase protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200 or more amino acids in length. In one embodiment, a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein comprises a heme-binding motif and/or at least one histidine motifs, preferably about three histidine motifs. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native desaturase protein. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In other embodiments, the desaturase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, yet differs in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. In another embodiment, the desaturase protein is a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In another embodiment, the invention features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. This invention further features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the length of the reference sequence (e.g., when aligning a second sequence to the Fad4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 having 519 amino acid residues, at least 156, preferably at least 208, more preferably at least 260, even more preferably at least 311, and even more preferably at least 363, 415, or 467 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 having 439 amino acid residues, at least 132, preferably at least 176, more preferably at least 220, even more preferably at least 263, and even more preferably at least 307, 351, or 395 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5-2 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 having 456 amino acid residues, at least 137, preferably at least 182, more preferably at least 228, even more preferably at least 273, and even more preferably at least 319, 365, or 419 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad6 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8 having 460 amino acid residues, at least 138, preferably at least 184, more preferably at least 230, even more preferably at least 276, and even more preferably at least 322, 368, or 414 amino acid residues are aligned). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid ‚Äúidentity‚Äù is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid ‚Äúhomology‚Äù). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch ( J. Mol. Biol . (48):444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package, using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A preferred, non-limiting example of parameters to be used in conjunction with the GAP program include a Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller ( Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:11-17 (1988)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0 or version 2.0U), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a ‚Äúquery sequence‚Äù to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to desaturase nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to desaturase protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. III. Methods of Producing Unsaturated Fatty Acids The present invention provides new and improved methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., LCPUFAs, such as, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 (n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 (n-6)), AA (Arachidonic acid, 20:4 (n-6)) and EPA (eicosapentaenioc acid, 20:5(n-3)). A. Recombinant Cells and Methods for Culturing Cells The present invention further features recombinant vectors that include nucleic acid sequences that encode the gene products as described herein, preferably Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 gene products. The term recombinant vector includes a vector (e.g., plasmid) that has been altered, modified or engineered such that it contains greater, fewer or different nucleic acid sequences than those included in the native vector or plasmid. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector includes the nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one fatty acid desaturase enzyme operably linked to regulatory sequences. The phrase ‚Äúoperably linked to regulatory sequence(s)‚Äù means that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression (e.g., enhanced, increased, constitutive, basal, attenuated, decreased or repressed expression) of the nucleotide sequence, preferably expression of a gene product encoded by the nucleotide sequence (e.g., when the recombinant vector is introduced into a cell). Exemplary vectors are described in further detail herein as well as in, for example, Frascotti et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,137, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The term ‚Äúregulatory sequence‚Äù includes nucleic acid sequences which affect (e.g., modulate or regulate) expression of other (non-regulatory) nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence is included in a recombinant vector in a similar or identical position and/or orientation relative to a particular gene of interest as is observed for the regulatory sequence and gene of interest as it appears in nature, e.g., in a native position and/or orientation. For example, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to the gene in the natural organism (e.g., operably linked to ‚Äúnative‚Äù Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequence (e.g., to the ‚Äúnative‚Äù Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 promoter). Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to another (e.g., a different) gene in the natural organism. For example, a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene can be included in a vector operably linked to non-Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequences. Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence from another organism. For example, regulatory sequences from other microbes (e.g., other bacterial regulatory sequences, bacteriophage regulatory sequences and the like) can be operably linked to a particular gene of interest. Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers, termination signals and other expression control elements (e.g., binding sites for transcriptional and/or translational regulatory proteins, for example, in the transcribed mRNA). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., constitutive promoters and strong constitutive promoters), those which direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., inducible promoters, for example, xylose inducible promoters) and those which attenuate or repress expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., attenuation signals or repressor sequences). It is also within the scope of the present invention to regulate expression of a gene of interest by removing or deleting regulatory sequences. For example, sequences involved in the negative regulation of transcription can be removed such that expression of a gene of interest is enhanced. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes nucleic acid sequences that encode at least one gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) operably linked to a promoter or promoter sequence. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes a terminator sequence or terminator sequences (e.g., transcription terminator sequences). The term ‚Äúterminator sequences‚Äù includes regulatory sequences which serve to terminate transcription of mRNA. Terminator sequences (or tandem transcription terminators) can further serve to stabilize mRNA (e.g., by adding structure to mRNA), for example, against nucleases. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes antibiotic resistance sequences. The term ‚Äúantibiotic resistance sequences‚Äù includes sequences which promote or confer resistance to antibiotics on the host organism. In one embodiment, the antibiotic resistance sequences are selected from the group consisting of cat (chloramphenicol resistance), tet (tetracycline resistance) sequences, erm (erythromycin resistance) sequences, neo (neomycin resistance) sequences and spec (spectinomycin resistance) sequences. Recombinant vectors of the present invention can further include homologous recombination sequences (e.g., sequences designed to allow recombination of the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host organism). For example, amyE sequences can be used as homology targets for recombination into the host chromosome. The term ‚Äúmanipulated cell‚Äù includes a cell that has been engineered (e.g., genetically engineered) or modified such that the cell has at least one fatty acid desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6, such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced. Modification or engineering of such microorganisms can be according to any methodology described herein including, but not limited to, deregulation of a biosynthetic pathway and/or overexpression of at least one biosynthetic enzyme. A ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù enzyme (e.g., a ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù biosynthetic enzyme) includes an enzyme, the expression or production of which has been altered or modified such that at least one upstream or downstream precursor, substrate or product of the enzyme is altered or modified, for example, as compared to a corresponding wild-type or naturally occurring enzyme. The term ‚Äúoverexpressed‚Äù or ‚Äúoverexpression‚Äù includes expression of a gene product (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase) at a level greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. In one embodiment, the cell can be genetically manipulated (e.g., genetically engineered) to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. Genetic manipulation can include, but is not limited to, altering or modifying regulatory sequences or sites associated with expression of a particular gene (e.g., by adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or by removing regulatory sequences such that expression is constitutive), modifying the chromosomal location of a particular gene, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to a particular gene such as a ribosome binding site or transcription terminator, increasing the copy number of a particular gene, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of a particular gene routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). In another embodiment, the cell can be physically or environmentally manipulated to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. For example, a cell can be treated with or cultured in the presence of an agent known or suspected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. Alternatively, a cell can be cultured at a temperature selected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. The term ‚Äúderegulated‚Äù or ‚Äúderegulation‚Äù includes the alteration or modification of at least one gene in a cell that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway, such that the level or activity of the biosynthetic enzyme in the cell is altered or modified. Preferably, at least one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the gene product is enhanced or increased. The phrase ‚Äúderegulated pathway‚Äù can also include a biosynthetic pathway in which more than one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the level or activity of more than one biosynthetic enzyme is altered or modified. The ability to ‚Äúderegulate‚Äù a pathway (e.g., to simultaneously deregulate more than one gene in a given biosynthetic pathway) in a cell arises from the particular phenomenon of cells in which more than one enzyme (e.g., two or three biosynthetic enzymes) are encoded by genes occurring adjacent to one another on a contiguous piece of genetic material termed an ‚Äúoperon‚Äù. The term ‚Äúoperon‚Äù includes a coordinated unit of gene expression that contains a promoter and possibly a regulatory element associated with one or more, preferably at least two, structural genes (e.g., genes encoding enzymes, for example, biosynthetic enzymes). Expression of the structural genes can be coordinately regulated, for example, by regulatory proteins binding to the regulatory element or by anti-termination of transcription. The structural genes can be transcribed to give a single mRNA that encodes all of the structural proteins. Due to the coordinated regulation of genes included in an operon, alteration or modification of the single promoter and/or regulatory element can result in alteration or modification of each gene product encoded by the operon. Alteration or modification of the regulatory element can include, but is not limited to removing the endogenous promoter and/or regulatory element(s), adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or removing regulatory sequences such that expression of the gene products is modified, modifying the chromosomal location of the operon, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the operon or within the operon such as a ribosome binding site, increasing the copy number of the operon, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of the operon and/or translation of the gene products of the operon, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of genes routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). Deregulation can also involve altering the coding region of one or more genes to yield, for example, an enzyme that is feedback resistant or has a higher or lower specific activity. A particularly preferred ‚Äúrecombinant‚Äù cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a plant-derived gene or gene product or an microorganismally-derived gene or gene product. The term ‚Äúplant-derived,‚Äù ‚Äúmicroorganismally-derived,‚Äù or ‚Äúderived-from,‚Äù for example, includes a gene which is naturally found in a microorganism or a plant, e.g., an oilseed plant, or a gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) or which is encoded by a plant gene or a gene from a microorganism (e.g., encoded SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7). The methodologies of the present invention feature recombinant cells which overexpress at least one fatty acid desaturase. In one embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Thrauschytrium sp. fatty acid desaturase (e.g., has been engineered to overexpress at least one of Thrauschytrium sp. Œî4 or Œî5 desaturase (the Fad4 or Fad5 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or 4 or encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3). In another embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Pythium irregulare Œî5 or Œî6 desaturase (the Fad5-2 or Fad6 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8 or encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 or 7). In another embodiment, the invention features a cell (e.g., a microbial cell) that has been transformed with a vector comprising a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7). Another aspect of the present invention features a method of modulating the production of fatty acids comprising culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., a desaturase) such that modulation of fatty acid production occurs (e.g., production of unsaturated fatty acids is enhanced). The method of culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6) to modulate the production of fatty acids is referred to herein as ‚Äúbiotransformation.‚Äù The biotransformation processes can utilize recombinant cells and/or desaturases described herein. The term ‚Äúbiotransformation process,‚Äù also referred to herein as ‚Äúbioconversion processes,‚Äù includes biological processes which result in the production (e.g., transformation or conversion) of any compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is upstream of a fatty acid desaturase to a compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is downstream of a fatty acid desaturase, in particular, an unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of an unsaturated fatty acid comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses at least one fatty acid desaturase with at least one appropriate substrate under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced and, optionally, recovering the fatty acid. In a preferred embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of unsaturated fatty acids comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 with an appropriate substrate (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid) under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA, SDA, or GLA) is produced and, optionally, recovering the unsaturated fatty acid. Conditions under which an unsaturated fatty acid is produced can include any conditions which result in the desired production of an unsaturated fatty acid. The cell(s) and/or enzymes used in the biotransformation reactions are in a form allowing them to perform their intended function (e.g., producing a desired fatty acids). The cells can be whole cells, or can be only those portions of the cells necessary to obtain the desired end result. The cells can be suspended (e.g., in an appropriate solution such as buffered solutions or media), rinsed (e.g., rinsed free of media from culturing the cell), acetone-dried, immobilized (e.g., with polyacrylamide gel or k-carrageenan or on synthetic supports, for example, beads, matrices and the like), fixed, cross-linked or permeablized (e.g., have permeablized membranes and/or walls such that compounds, for example, substrates, intermediates or products can more easily pass through said membrane or wall). The type of cell can be any cell capable of being used within the methods of the invention, e.g., plant, animal, or microbial cells. An important aspect of the present invention involves growing the recombinant plant or culturing the recombinant microorganisms described herein, such that a desired compound (e.g., a desired unsaturated fatty acid) is produced. The term ‚Äúculturing‚Äù includes maintaining and/or growing a living microorganism of the present invention (e.g., maintaining and/or growing a culture or strain). In one embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in liquid media. In another embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in solid media or semi-solid media. In a preferred embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in media (e.g., a sterile, liquid media) comprising nutrients essential or beneficial to the maintenance and/or growth of the microorganism (e.g., carbon sources or carbon substrate, for example complex carbohydrates such as bean or grain meal, starches, sugars, sugar alcohols, hydrocarbons, oils, fats, fatty acids, organic acids and alcohols; nitrogen sources, for example, vegetable proteins, peptones, peptides and amino acids derived from grains, beans and tubers, proteins, peptides and amino acids derived form animal sources such as meat, milk and animal byproducts such as peptones, meat extracts and casein hydrolysates; inorganic nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate; phosphorus sources, for example, phosphoric acid, sodium and potassium salts thereof; trace elements, for example, magnesium, iron, manganese, calcium, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum, and/or cobalt salts; as well as growth factors such as amino acids, vitamins, growth promoters and the like). Preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled pH. The term ‚Äúcontrolled pH‚Äù includes any pH which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of about 7. In another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.5. The desired pH may be maintained by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art. Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled aeration. The term ‚Äúcontrolled aeration‚Äù includes sufficient aeration (e.g., oxygen) to result in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, aeration is controlled by regulating oxygen levels in the culture, for example, by regulating the amount of oxygen dissolved in culture media. Preferably, aeration of the culture is controlled by agitating the culture. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the growth vessel (e.g., fermentor) or by various pumping equipment. Aeration may be further controlled by the passage of sterile air or oxygen through the medium (e.g., through the fermentation mixture). Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured without excess foaming (e.g., via addition of antifoaming agents). Moreover, plants or microorganisms of the present invention can be cultured under controlled temperatures. The term ‚Äúcontrolled temperature‚Äù includes any temperature which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞ C. and 95¬∞ C. In another embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞ C. and 70¬∞ C. Preferred temperatures are between 20¬∞ C. and 55¬∞ C., more preferably between 30¬∞ C. and 45¬∞ C. or between 30¬∞ C. and 50¬∞ C. Microorganisms can be cultured (e.g., maintained and/or grown) in liquid media and preferably are cultured, either continuously or intermittently, by conventional culturing methods such as standing culture, test tube culture, shaking culture (e.g., rotary shaking culture, shake flask culture, etc.), aeration spinner culture, or fermentation. In a preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in shake flasks. In a more preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in a fermentor (e.g., a fermentation process). Fermentation processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, batch, fed-batch and continuous methods of fermentation. The phrase ‚Äúbatch process‚Äù or ‚Äúbatch fermentation‚Äù refers to a closed system in which the composition of media, nutrients, supplemental additives and the like is set at the beginning of the fermentation and not subject to alteration during the fermentation, however, attempts may be made to control such factors as pH and oxygen concentration to prevent excess media acidification and/or microorganism death. The phrase ‚Äúfed-batch process‚Äù or ‚Äúfed-batch‚Äù fermentation refers to a batch fermentation with the exception that one or more substrates or supplements are added (e.g., added in increments or continuously) as the fermentation progresses. The phrase ‚Äúcontinuous process‚Äù or ‚Äúcontinuous fermentation‚Äù refers to a system in which a defined fermentation media is added continuously to a fermentor and an equal amount of used or ‚Äúconditioned‚Äù media is simultaneously removed, preferably for recovery of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). A variety of such processes have been developed and are well-known in the art. The phrase ‚Äúculturing under conditions such that a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid, for example, DHA) is produced‚Äù includes maintaining and/or growing plants or microorganisms under conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, duration, etc.) appropriate or sufficient to obtain production of the desired compound or to obtain desired yields of the particular compound being produced. For example, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to produce the desired amount of a unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA). Preferably, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to substantially reach maximal production of the unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, culturing is continued for about 12 to 24 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for about 24 to 36 hours, 36 to 48 hours, 48 to 72 hours, 72 to 96 hours, 96 to 120 hours, 120 to 144 hours, or greater than 144 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to reach production yields of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, cells are cultured such that at least about 15 to 20 g/L of unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 20 to 25 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 25 to 30 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 30 to 35 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 35 to 40 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced (e.g., at least about 37 g/L unsaturated fatty acids) or at least about 40 to 50 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced. In yet another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured under conditions such that a preferred yield of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, a yield within a range set forth above, is produced in about 24 hours, in about 36 hours, in about 48 hours, in about 72 hours, or in about 96 hours. In producing unsaturated fatty acids, it may further be desirable to culture cells of the present invention in the presence of supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates. The term ‚Äúsupplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrate‚Äù includes an agent or compound which, when brought into contact with a cell or included in the culture medium of a cell, serves to enhance or increase unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added in the form of a concentrated solution or suspension (e.g., in a suitable solvent such as water or buffer) or in the form of a solid (e.g., in the form of a powder). Moreover, supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added as a single aliquot, continuously or intermittently over a given period of time. The methodology of the present invention can further include a step of recovering a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). The term ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù a desired compound includes extracting, harvesting, isolating or purifying the compound from culture media. Recovering the compound can be performed according to any conventional isolation or purification methodology known in the art including, but not limited to, treatment with a conventional resin (e.g., anion or cation exchange resin, non-ionic adsorption resin, etc.), treatment with a conventional adsorbent (e.g., activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina, etc.), alteration of pH, solvent extraction (e.g., with a conventional solvent such as an alcohol, ethyl acetate, hexane and the like), dialysis, filtration, concentration, crystallization, recrystallization, pH adjustment, lyophilization and the like. For example, a compound can be recovered from culture media by first removing the microorganisms from the culture. Media is then passed through or over a cation exchange resin to remove unwanted cations and then through or over an anion exchange resin to remove unwanted inorganic anions and organic acids having stronger acidities than the unsaturated fatty acid of interest (e.g., DHA). Preferably, a desired compound of the present invention is ‚Äúextracted,‚Äù ‚Äúisolated‚Äù or ‚Äúpurified‚Äù such that the resulting preparation is substantially free of other components (e.g., free of media components and/or fermentation byproducts). The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of other components‚Äù includes preparations of desired compound in which the compound is separated (e.g., purified or partially purified) from media components or fermentation byproducts of the culture from which it is produced. In one embodiment, the preparation has greater than about 80% (by dry weight) of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 20% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), more preferably greater than about 90% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 10% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), still more preferably greater than about 95% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 5% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), and most preferably greater than about 98-99% desired compound (e.g., less than about 1-2% other media components or fermentation byproducts). When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to a salt, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the salt. When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to an alcohol, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the alcohol. In an alternative embodiment, the desired unsaturated fatty acid is not purified from the plant or microorganism, for example, when the plant or microorganism is biologically non-hazardous (e.g., safe). For example, the entire plant or culture (or culture supernatant) can be used as a source of product (e.g., crude product). In one embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) supernatant is used without modification. In another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is concentrated. In yet another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is pulverized, dried, or lyophilized. B. High Yield Production Methodologies A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention is a high yield production method for producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., DHA, comprising culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that the unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a significantly high yield. The phrase ‚Äúhigh yield production method,‚Äù for example, a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) includes a method that results in production of the desired compound at a level which is elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods. Preferably, a high yield production method results in production of the desired compound at a significantly high yield. The phrase ‚Äúsignificantly high yield‚Äù includes a level of production or yield which is sufficiently elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods, for example, which is elevated to a level sufficient for commercial production of the desired product (e.g., production of the product at a commercially feasible cost). In one embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 2 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 10 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 20 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 40 g/L. The invention further features a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) that involves culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that a sufficiently elevated level of compound is produced within a commercially desirable period of time. In an exemplary embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 15-20 g/L in 36 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 25-30 g/L in 48 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 35-40 g/L in 72 hours, for example, greater that 37 g/L in 72 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30-40 g/L in 60 hours, for example, greater that 30, 35 or 40 g/L in 60 hours. Values and ranges included and/or intermediate within the ranges set forth herein are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention. For example, unsaturated fatty acid production at levels of at least 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 g/L in 60 hours are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. In another example, ranges of 30-35 g/L or 35-40 g/L are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. Moreover, the skilled artisan will appreciate that culturing a manipulated microorganism to achieve a production level of, for example, ‚Äú30-40 g/L in 60 hours‚Äù includes culturing the microorganism for additional time periods (e.g., time periods longer than 60 hours), optionally resulting in even higher yields of an unsaturated fatty acid being produced. IV. Compositions The desaturase nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and fragments thereof, of the invention can be used to produce unsaturated fatty acids which can be incorporated into compositions. Compositions of the present invention include, e.g., compositions for use as animal feed, compositions for use as neutraceuticals (e.g., dietary supplements), and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise an unsaturated fatty acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language ‚Äúpharmaceutically acceptable carrier‚Äù is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL‚Ñ¢ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a LCPUFA, or a fragment thereof, produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with a LCPUFA in the range of between about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody, protein, or polypeptide used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent from the results of diagnostic assays as described herein. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the figures, are incorporated herein by reference. EXAMPLES Materials: Thraustochytrium s.p ATCC 21685 and Pythium irregulare were purchased from American type culture collection (12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., 20852 USA) and grown in a medium (Weete, J. D., et al. (1997) Lipids 32:839-845) at 24¬∞ C. for 7 days. After then biomass were harvested by centrifugation and used for RNA isolation. Example 1 Construction and Screening of cDNA Library Total RNA was isolated from the above materials according to Qiu and Erickson (Qiu, X. and Eriekson, L. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. Repr. 12:209-214). The cDNA library was constructed from the total RNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase from Gibco-BRL. The second strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I from Stratagene. After size fractionation, cDNA inserts larger than 1 kb were ligated into Œª Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene). The recombinant ÀúDNAs were then packed with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) and plated on NZY plates. The resulting library represented more than 5√ó106 independent clones. Screening of the cDNA library was performed according to standard methods (Sambrook, J, Fritseh, E. F., Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular cloning‚ÄîA laboratory manual. (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA.) Example 2 RT-PCR The single strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) from total RNA and was then used as the template for PCR reaction with two degenerate primers (The forward primer: GCNCA/GANGANCAC/TCCNGGXGG (SEQ ID NO:9) and the reverse primer: ATNTG/TNGGA/GAANAG/AG/ATGG/ATG (SEQ ID NO:10)). The PCR amplification consisted of 35 cycles with 1 min at 94¬∞ C., 1.5 min at 55¬∞ C. and 2 min at 72¬∞ C. followed by an extension step at 72¬∞ C. for 10 min. The amplified products from 800 bp to 1000 bp were isolated from agarose gel and purified by a kit (Qiaex II gel purification, Qiagen), and subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR¬Æ2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were then sequenced by PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). Example 3 Expression of FAD4, FAD5, FAD5-2, AND FAD6 in Yeast The open reading frames of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 were amplified by PCR using the Precision Plus enzyme (Stratagene) and cloned into a TA cloning vector (pCR¬Æ2.1, Invitrogen). Having confirmed that the PCR products were identical to the original cDNAs by sequencing, the fragments were then released by a BamHI-EcoRI double digestion and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the inducible promoter GAL1. Yeast strains InvSc2 (Invitrogen) was transformed with the expression constructs using the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil (Gietz, D., et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20:1425; Covello, P. S. and Reed, D. W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226). Transformants were first grown in minimal medium lacking uracil and containing glucose at 28¬∞ C. After overnight culture, the cells were spun down, washed and resuspended in distilled water. Minimal medium containing 2% galactose, with or without 0.3 mM substrate fatty acids in the presence of 0.1% tergitol, was inoculated with the yeast transformant cell suspension and incubated at 20¬∞ C. for three days, and then 15¬∞ C. for another three days. Example 4 Fatty Acid Analysis Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare and yeast cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water. Then 2 mL methanolic KOH (7.5% w/v KOH in 95% methanol) was added to the materials and the mixture sealed in a 12 ml glass culture tube was heated to 80¬∞ C. for 2 hours. 0.5 mL water was added and the sample was extracted twice with 2 mL hexane to remove the non-saponifiable lipids. The remaining aqueous phase was then acidified by adding 1 mL 6 N HCl and extracted twice with 2 mL hexane. The hexane phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. 2 mL 3 N methanolic HCl (SUPELCO, Supelco Park, Bellefonte, Pa. 16823-0048) was added and the mixture was heated at 80¬∞ C. for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL 0.9% NaCl was added and the mixture extracted twice with 2√ó2 mL hexane. The combined hexane was evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS according to Covello & Reed (Covello, P. S. and Reed, D. W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226). GC/MS analysis was performed in standard EI mode using a Fisons VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, UK) controlled by Masslynx version 2.0 software, coupled to a GC 8000 Series gas chromatograph. A DB-23 column (30M√ó0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 Ilm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, Calif.) that was temperature-programmed at 180¬∞ C. for 1 min, then 4 C/min to 240¬∞ C. and held for 15 minutes, was used for FAME analysis. Example 5 Transformation of Brassica juncea and Flax (Linum usitatissimum) and Exogenous Fatty Acid Treatment The hypocotyls of 5-6 day seedlings of B. juncea and flax were used as explants for inoculation with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens that hosts binary vectors with the full-length cDNAs under the control of the different promoters. The 20-day transgenic seedlings were used for exogenous fatty acid treatment. The seedling was divided into three parts: leaves, stems and roots. Each was cut into the small pieces and placed in a 24-well titer plate. To each well, 2 mL 0.05% sodium salt of substrates (NuCheck Prep Inc., Elysian, Minn.) was added. The plate was then incubated at 24¬∞ C. for 4 h with gentle shaking. After incubation, the plant tissues were washed three times with water and then used for fatty acid analysis. Example 6 Fatty Acid Profile of the Thrauschytrium sp. Thraustochytrium and Pythium irregulare have recently drawn scientific attention due to its ability in production of LCPUFAs such as DHA, AA, EPA and DPA. FIGS. 23 and 24 show the fatty acid composition of the lipids isolated from 7 day cultures of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , respectively. As shown in the tables, the microorganisms contain a broad range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from both n-3 and n-6 families, from 18-carbon Œî6 fatty acids (gamma-linolenic acid and steardonic acid) to 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids (DHA and DPA). The organisms, especially Thraustochytrium sp., appear to contain a full-set of desaturation and elongation enzymes required for the DHA and DPA biosynthesis. The strain lacks 24-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, the proposed precursors for DHA and DPA synthesis in Precher's pathway (Voss, A., et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:19995-20000; Mohammed, B. S., et al. (1997) Biochem. J. 326:425-430). The 24-carbon fatty acid may not be involved in in vivo synthesis of 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids such as DHA and DPA in Thraustochytrium sp. Example 7 Identification of cDNAs Coding for the ‚ÄúFront-End‚Äù Desaturase To identify genes coding for desaturases involved in biosynthesis of LCFUFAs in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , a PCR-based cloning strategy was adopted. Two degenerate primers are designed to target the heme-binding motif of N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in front-end desaturases and the third conservative histidine motif in all microsomal desaturases, respectively. The rational behind the design is that the desaturases involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , should have similar primary structure as other front-end desaturases, i.e. N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in the desaturase. Four cDNAs fragments were identified from Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare that encode fusion proteins containing cyt b5-like domain in the N-terminus. To isolate full-length cDNA clones, the four inserts were used as probes to screen cDNA libraries of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , which resulted in identification of several cDNA clones in each group. Sequencing of all those clones identified four full-length cDNAs which were named as Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2 and Fad6. The open reading frame of Fad4 is 1560 bp and codes for 519 amino acids with molecular weight of 59.1 kDa ( FIG. 1 ). Fad5 is 1230 bp in length and codes for 439 amino acids with molecular weight of 49.8 kDa ( FIG. 2 ). A sequence comparison of these two sequences from Thraustochytrium sp. showed only 16% amino acid identity between the deduced proteins. A detailed analysis revealed that Fad4 is 80 amino acids longer than Fad5, occurring between the second and third conservative histidine motifs ( FIG. 3 ). The open reading frame of Fad5-2 from Pythium irregulare is 1371 bp and codes for 456 amino acids ( FIG. 4 ). Fad6 from Pythium irregulare is 1383 bp in length and codes for 460 amino acids ( FIG. 5 ). Sequence comparison of the two sequences from Pythium irregulare showed over 39% similarity between the deduced proteins ( FIG. 6 ). A BLASTP‚Ñ¢ search of the protein database revealed the following hits for each of the four proteins, Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6: Fad 4 (519 Amino Acid Residues) Blastp nr AccessionNo.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF067654Mortierella alpinaŒî5 fatty acid50929desaturaseAF054824Mortierella alpinaŒî5 microsomal50928desaturaseAB022097DictyosteliumŒî5 fatty acid50727discoideumdesaturaseAB029311Dictyosteliumfatty acid51926discoideumdesaturaseL11421Synechocystis sp.Œî6 desaturase41025D90914 Fad 5 (439 Amino Acid Residues) Blastp nr AccessionNo.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF139720Euglena gracilisŒî8 fatty acid40429desaturaseAF007561Borago officinalisŒî6 desaturase42127U79010Borago officinalisŒî6 desaturase42127AF309556Danio rerioŒî6 fatty acid42226desaturaseAF110510Mortierella alpinaŒî6 fatty acid46325desaturase Fad 5-2 (456 Amino Acid Residues) Blastp nr AccessionNo.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAB029311DictosteliumFatty acid44341discoideumdesaturaseAB022097DictosteliumŒî5 fatty acid44539discoideumdesaturaseAF067654Mortierella alpinaŒî5 fatty acid44138desaturaseAF054824Mortierella alpinaŒî5 microsomal44138desaturaseL11421Synechocystis sp.Œî6 desaturase36128D90914 Fad 6 (459 Amino Acid Residues) Blastp nr AccessionNo.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF110510Mortierella alpinaŒî6 fatty acid43738desaturaseAB020032Mortierella alpinaŒî6 fatty acid43738desaturaseAF306634Mortierella isabellinaŒî6 fatty acid43738desaturaseAF307940Mortierella alpinaŒî6 fatty acid43838desaturaseAJ250735Ceratodon purpureusŒî6 fatty acid43836desaturase Example 8 Expression of FAD4, FAD5, FAD5-2, and FAD6 in Yeast To confirm the function of Fad4, the full-length cDNA was expressed in the yeast strain InvSc2 under the control of the inducible promoter. FIG. 7 shows that with supplementation of the medium with 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19), yeast cells containing Fad4 cDNA had an extra fatty acid as compared to the vector control. The peak has a retention time identical to the DHA standard. LC/MS analysis of the free fatty acid showed that it yields deprotonated molecular ions (m/z=279) identical to the DHA standard in negative ion electrospray. Moreover, GC/MS analysis of the FAME confirmed that the spectrum of the peak is identical to that of the DHA standard ( FIG. 8 ). These results indicate that Fad4 is a Œî4 fatty acid desaturase which is able to introduce a double bond at position 4 of the 22:5(7,10,13,16,19) substrate, resulting in a Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DHA (22:6-4,7,10,13,16,19). To further study the substrate specificity of the Fad4, a number of substrates including 18:2(9,12), 18:3(9,12,15), 20:3(8,11,14) and 22:4(7,10,13,16) were separately supplied to the yeast transformants. The results indicated Fad4 could also use 22:4 (7,10,13,16) as a substrate ( FIG. 9 ) to produce another Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DPA (22:5-4,7,10,13,16) ( FIG. 10 ). The rest of the fatty acids examined were not effective substrates. To confirm the function of Fad5 and Fad5-2, the S. cerevisiae Invsc2 was transformed with plasmids, which contain the open reading frame of the Fad5 and Fad5-2 respectively under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter. When the yeast transformants were induced by galactose in a medium containing homo-gamma-linolenic acid (HGLA, 20:3-8,11,14), an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 11 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the fatty acid had a retention time identical to the arachidonic acid standard (AA, 20:4-5,8,11,14). To further confirm the regiochemistry of the products, the FAMEs were analyzed by GC/MS. FIG. 12 indicates that the mass spectra of the new fatty acid and the AA standard are identical. These results demonstrate that Fad5 and Fad5-2 convert HGLA (20:3-8,11,13) into AA (20:4-5,8,11,14) in yeast. To further study the substrate specificity of Fad5-2, the plasmid containing Fad5-2 was transferred into another yeast strain AMY-2Œ± where ole1, a Œî9 desaturase gene, is disrupted. The strain is unable to grow in minimal media without supplementation with mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In this experiment, the strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 17:1(10Z), a non-substrate of Fad5-2, which enabled study of the specificity of the enzyme towards various substrates, especially monounsaturates. A number of possible substrates including 16:1(9Z), 18:1(9Z), 18:1(11Z), 18:1(11E), 18:1(12E), 18:1(15Z), 18:2(9Z,12Z), 18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z), 20:2(11Z,14Z) and 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) were tested. Results indicated that Fad5-2 could desaturate unsaturated fatty acids with Œî9 ethylenic and Œî11 ethylenic double bonds, as well as the fatty acid with Œî8 ethylenic double bond (20:3-8,11,14). As shown in FIG. 13 , Fad5-2 effectively converted both 18:1 (9Z) and 18:1 (11 Z) substrates into their corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids, 18:2-5,9 (the retention time 10.34 min) and 18:1-5,11 (the retention time 10.44 min), respectively. Fad5-2 also desaturated trans fatty acid such as 18:1(11E) and 18:1(12E). FIG. 25 is a comparison of substrate preference of Fad5-2 for fatty acid substrates tested in the yeast strain AMY-2Œ±. The relative proportions of the substrates and the products accumulated are a useful indicator of substrate preference of the enzyme. As shown in FIG. 25 , Fad5-2 prefers fatty acids with 20-carbon as substrates, such as 20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z), 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) and 20:2(11Z,14Z). Whereas, the shorter chain fatty acid is a relatively weaker substrate for the enzyme in yeast. To confirm the function of Fad6, the S. cerevisiae host strain Invsc2 was transformed with a plasmid containing the open reading frame of Fad6 under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter, GAL1. When the yeast transformant was induced by galactose in a medium containing linoleic acid, an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of the FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 14 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the peak had a retention time identical to the gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3-6,9,12) standard. To confirm the regioselectivity of the products, the diethylamine derivatives of fatty acids from the expressing strain were analyzed by GC-MS. FIG. 15 shows that the new peak is indeed GLA with three double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions. Major fragments of n and n+1 carbons differing by 12 D are diagnostic of a double bond between carbon n+1 and n+2. Thus, the fragments at 156 and 168, 196 and 208, and 236 and 248, indicate double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions, respectively. These results demonstrate that Fad6 is a Œî6 desaturase that converts linoleic acid (18:2) to GLA in yeast. Example 9 Expression of FAD4 in B. juncea To determine whether Traustochytrium Fad4 is functional in oilseed crops, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad4 under the control of a constitutive promoter. Eight independent transgenic plants were obtained. In B. juncea there is no Œî4 fatty acid desaturase substrates available. Thus, to examine the activity of the transgenic enzyme in the plants, the 22:5 (n-3) substrate must be exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium docosapentaeneate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of both types of plants, but converted into DHA only in transgenics. Leaves have a higher level of production of DHA than roots and stems. In leaves, the exogenous substrate was incorporated to a level of 10-20% of the total fatty acids and Œî4 desaturated fatty acid (22:6, n-3) was produced in a range of 3-6% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 16 ). These results indicate that the Œî4 fatty acid desaturase from Traustochytrium is functional in oilseed crops. Example 10 Expression of FAD5-2 in B. juncea To determine whether Fad5-2 is functional in oilseed crops and its expression has any effect on their growth and development, B. juncea were transformed with a binary vector that contained Fad5-2 cDNA behind a constitutive promoter (a tandem cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter). Six independent primary transgenic plants were obtained and the fatty acid profile of lipids from different tissues was determined. FIG. 17 shows the fatty acid composition of three-week-old seedling plants from one T 1 line. Compared with wild type, all transgenic plant tissues have an altered fatty acid profile containing four additional peaks which were identified as four different Œî5-undesaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids (Œî5-UPIFAs), specifically, taxoleic (18:2-5,9); ephedrenic (18:2-5,11); pinolenic (18:3-5,9,12), and coniferonic acids (18:4-5,9,12,15). Thus B. juncea , like yeast, can functionally express the P. irregulare Œî5 desaturase to convert the endogenous substrates 18:1-9; 18:1-11; 18:2-9,12, and 18:3-9,12,15 to the corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids. The roots produced the highest amount of the Œî5-UPIFAs, representing more than 20% of the total fatty acids, followed by 6% in stems and 5% in leaves ( FIG. 17 ). In B. juncea there is no homo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3-8,11,14) substrate available. Thus, to examine whether the transgenic plant can produce AA, the substrate 20:3(8,11,14) was exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium homo-gamma-linolenate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of transgenic plants and converted into AA in plants ( FIG. 18 ). There was no observable phenotypic effect on the growth and development in the transgenic B. juncea , although the Œî5-UPIFAs accumulated in all parts of the plant. Growth and differentiation of vegetative tissues such as the leaves, stems, and roots were indistinguishable from the corresponding wild type. To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in seeds, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad5-2 cDNA behind a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Fatty acid analysis of transgenic seeds showed that there were two new fatty acids appearing in the gas chromatogram of transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 19 ). They were identified as taxoleic acid (18:2-5,9) and pinolenic acids (18:3-5,9,12). Together, these fatty acids represent 9.4% of the seed fatty acids. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs has no significant effect on the oleic acid content compared with the untransformed control. Example 11 Expression of FAD5-2 in Flax To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, flax was transformed with Fad5-2 under the control of two seed-specific promoters, a heterologous B. napus napin promoter, and a flax endogenous promoter. As shown in FIG. 26 , transgenic plants containing the napin promoter produced one Œî5 desaturated fatty acid, taxoleic acid in seeds at the level of less than 1% of the total fatty acids. Whereas transgenic plants containing the flax seed-specific promoter produced three Œî5 desaturated fatty acids: taxoleic, pinolenic, and coniferonic acid. Of these, taxoleic (18:2-5,9) was the most abundant and accounted for more than 9% of the total fatty acids in a elite line (FN-10-1), followed by coniferonic and pinolenic acids. Surprisingly, accumulation of Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in transgenic seeds has significant impact on the composition of other fatty acids, especially the oleic acid level. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs was accompanied by a huge increase of the oleic acids in both types of transgenic plants expressing Fad5-2 desaturase under the control of the different promoters. The content of oleic acid in transgenic plants with the napin and flax seed-specific promoters, on the average, reached 44.7% and 24.3% of the total fatty acids, respectively, relative to the untransformed control at 17.4%. Example 12 Expression of FAD6 in Flax To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, two types of flax were transformed with the construct that contains Fad6 cDNA under the control of a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Type I flax (Normandy) is a traditional industrial oilseed crop, whereas Type II (Solin) is an edible oilseed crop derived from chemical mutagenesis of Type I. A total of twelve transgenic plants were produced. The majority of transgenics exhibited two novel fatty acids whose retention times correspond to GLA and SDA and they constitute 0.1 to 4.3% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 27 ). The level of GLA in transgenic Solin type is higher than that of SDA, while GLA in transgenic Normandy is lower than SDA. This is understandable because linoleic acid is a major fatty acid in Solin type linseed while Œ±-linolenic acid is a major fatty acid in Normandy seeds. Example 13 Expression of FAD6 in B. juncea To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in seeds of B. juncea, B. juncea were transformed with the same construct used in flax transformation, i.e., Fad6 under the control of the B. napus napin promoter. Fifteen independent transgenic plants were obtained. Fatty acid analysis of the transgenic seeds showed that there were three new fatty acids in the gas chromatogram of most transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 20 ). The three fatty acids were identified as 18:2(6,9) and 18:3(6,9,12), and 18:4(6,9,12,15). B. juncea , like flax, can also functionally express Fad6 from P. irregulare , introducing a double bond at position 6 of endogenous substrate 18:1(9), 18:2(9,12), and 18:3(6,9,12) resulting in production of three corresponding Œî6 fatty acids in the transgenic seeds. Among the three new fatty acids produced in transgenic seeds, GLA is the most abundant one, with a level in transgenic seeds of 30% to 38% of the total fatty acids. The next most abundant component is SDA, which accounts for 3-10% of the total fatty acids in several transgenic lines ( FIG. 21 ). The fatty acid compositions of transgenic seeds are shown in FIG. 22 . It is clear that the high level production of Œî6 desaturated fatty acids is at the cost of two major fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acids. Proportions of oleic and stearic acids in transgenics are slightly reduced, but not significantly compared to those in the wild type control. The content of linoleic acid in the transgenics was dramatically reduced. In the untransformed wild type, linoleic acid accounts for more than 40% of the total fatty acids in seeds. In transgenics, the level was reduced to less than 10%. As compared to the reduction of linoleic acid in transgenics, the decrease in linolenic acid in transgenics is less dramatic, but still significant. In the untransformed wild type, linolenic acid accounts for more than 10% of the total fatty acids in seeds while in transgenics the level was reduced to less than 5%. The two dramatically reduced fatty acids in transgenic seeds are the substrates of the Œî6 desaturase, and the reduction is the cost for producing two corresponding Œî6 desaturated fatty acids.

The entire contents of all references cited therein also are expressly incorporated by reference and are intended to be part of the present application.\\n\\n\\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \\n\\n    Fatty acids are carboxylic acids with long-chain hydrocarbon side groups and play a fundamental role in many biological processes. Fatty acids are rarely free in nature but, rather, occur in esterified form as the major component of lipids. Lipids/fatty acids are sources of energy (e.g., b-oxidation) and are an integral part of cell membranes which are indispensable for processing biological or biochemical information. \\n\\n    Fatty acids can be divided into two groups: the saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids which contain one or more carbon double bond in cis-configuration. Unsaturated fatty acids are produced by terminal desaturases that belong to the class of nonheme-iron enzymes. Each of these enzymes are part of a electron-transport system that contains two other proteins, namely cytochrome b ‚ÇÖ and NADH-cytochrome b ‚ÇÖ reductase. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. Human and other mammals have a limited spectrum of these desaturases that are required for the formation of particular double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, humans have to take up some fatty acids through their diet. Such essential fatty acids, for example, are linoleic acid (C18:2); linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4). In contrast, insects and plants are able to synthesize a much larger variety of unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. \\n\\n    Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)) are essential components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). For example, over 30% of fatty acids in brain phospholipid are 22:6 (n-3) and 20:4 (n-6). (Crawford, M. A., et al., (1997) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66:1032S-1041S). In retina, DHA accounts for more than 60% of the total fatty acids in the rod outer segment, the photosensitive part of the photoreceptor cell. (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has significant effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, some positive effects of DHA were also found on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Therefore, the appropriate dietary supply of the fatty acid is important for humans to remain healthy. It is particularly important for infant, young children and senior citizens to adequately intake these fatty acids from the diet since they cannot be efficiently synthesized in their body and must be supplemented by food (Spector, A. A. (1999) Lipids 34:S1-S3). \\n\\n    DHA is a fatty acid of the n-3 series according to the location of the last double bond in the methyl end. It is synthesized via alternating steps of desaturation and elongation. Starting with 18:3 (9,12,15), biosynthesis of DHA involves 6 desaturation to 18:4 (6,9,12,15), followed by elongation to 20:4 (8,11,14,17) and 5 desaturation to 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17). Beyond this point, there are some controversies about the biosynthesis. The conventional view is that 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17) is elongated to 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19) and then converted to 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19) by the final 4 desaturation (Horrobin, D. F. (1992) Prog. Lipid Res. 31:163-194). However, Sprecher et al. recently suggested an alternative pathway for DHA biosynthesis, which is independent of 4 desaturase, involving two consecutive elongations, a 6 desaturation and a two-carbon shortening via limited -oxidation in peroxisome (Sprecher, H., et al. (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36:2471-2477; Sprecher, H., et al. (1999) Lipids 34:S153-S156). \\n\\n    Production of DHA is important because of its beneficial effect on human health. Currently the major sources of DHA are oils from fish and algae. Fish oil is a major and traditional source for this fatty acid, however, it is usually oxidized by the time it is sold. In addition, the supply of the oil is highly variable and its source is in jeopardy with the shrinking fish populations while the algal source is expensive due to low yield and the high costs of extraction. \\n\\n    EPA and AA are both 5 essential fatty acids. They form a unique class of food and feed constituents for humans and animals. EPA belongs to the n-3 series with five double bonds in the acyl chain, is found in marine food, and is abundant in oily fish from North Atlantic. AA belongs to the n-6 series with four double bonds. The lack of a double bond in the -3 position confers on AA different properties than those found in EPA. The eicosanoids produced from AA have strong inflammatory and platelet aggregating properties, whereas those derived from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet aggregating properties. AA can be obtained from some foods such as meat, fish, and eggs, but the concentration is low. \\n\\n    Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is another essential fatty acid found in mammals. GLA is the metabolic intermediate for very long chain n-6 fatty acids and for various active molecules. In mammals, formation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is rate-limited by 6 desaturation. Many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, stress, diabetes, eczema, and some infections have been shown to depress the 6 desaturation step. In addition, GLA is readily catabolized from the oxidation and rapid cell division associated with certain disorders, e.g., cancer or inflammation. Therefore, dietary supplementation with GLA can reduce the risks of these disorders. Clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation with GLA is effective in treating some pathological conditions such as atopic eczema, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders. \\n\\n    The predominant sources of GLA are oils from plants such as evening primrose ( Oenothera biennis ), borage ( Borago officinalis L.), black currant ( Ribes nigrum ), and from microorganisms such as Mortierella sp., Mucor sp., and Cyanobacteria. However, these GLA sources are not ideal for dietary supplementation due to large fluctuations in availability and costs associated with extraction processes. \\n\\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \\n\\n    The biosynthesis of fatty acids is a major activity of plants and microorganisms. However, humans have a limited capacity for synthesizing essential fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Biotechnology has long been considered an efficient way to manipulate the process of producing fatty acids in plants and microorganisms. It is cost-effective and renewable with little side effects. Thus, tremendous industrial effort directed to the production of various compounds including speciality fatty acids and pharmaceutical polypeptides through the manipulation of plant, animal, and microorganismal cells has ensued. Accordingly, biotechnology is an attractive route for producing unsaturated fatty acids, especially LCPUFAs, in a safe, cost-efficient manner so as to garner the maximum therapeutic value from these fatty acids. \\n\\n    The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a family of nucleic acid molecules encoding novel desaturases. In particular, the present inventors have identified the Fad 4 (4 desaturase), Fad5 and Fad5-2 (5 desaturase), and Fad6 (6 desaturase) which are involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6, n-3) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5, n-6); more specifically, Fad4 desaturases 22:5 (n-3) and 22:4 (n-6) resulting in DHA and DPA; Fad5 and Fad5-2 desaturases 20:4 (n-3) and 20:3(n-6) resulting in EPA and AA; and Fad6 desaturases 18:2 (n-6) and 18:3(n-3) resulting in GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) and SDA (stearidonic acid). \\n\\n    In one embodiment, the invention features an isolated nucleic acid molecule that includes the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7. In another embodiment, the invention features an isolated nucleic acid molecule that encodes a polypeptide including the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. \\n\\n    In still other embodiments, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules including nucleotide sequences that are substantially identical (e.g., 70% identical) to the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7. The invention further features isolated nucleic acid molecules including at least 30 contiguous nucleotides of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7. In another embodiment, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a polypeptide including an amino acid sequence that is substantially identical (e.g., 50% identical) to the amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. Also featured are nucleic acid molecules which encode allelic variants of the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In addition to isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding full-length polypeptides, the present invention also features nucleic acid molecules which encode fragments, for example, biologically active fragments, of the full-length polypeptides of the present invention (e.g., fragments including at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8). In still other embodiments, the invention features nucleic acid molecules that are complementary to, or hybridize under stringent conditions to the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein. \\n\\n    In a related aspect, the invention provides vectors including the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein (e.g., desaturase-encoding nucleic acid molecules). Also featured are host cells including such vectors (e.g., host cells including vectors suitable for producing desaturase nucleic acid molecules and polypeptides). \\n\\n    In another aspect, the invention features isolated desaturase polypeptides and/or biologically active fragments thereof.

Also featured are fragments of the full-length polypeptides described herein (e.g., fragments including at least 10 contiguous amino acid residues of the sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8) as well as allelic variants of the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. \\n\\n    In one embodiment, a desaturase polypeptide or fragment thereof has a desaturase activity. In another embodiment, a desaturase polypeptide, or fragment thereof, has an N-terminal heme-binding motif, e.g., a cytochrome b5-like domain found in front-end desaturases. In another embodiment, a desaturase polypeptide, or fragment thereof, has at least two, preferably about three, conservative histidine motifs found in all microsomal desaturases and, optionally, has a desaturase activity. In a preferred embodiment, the desaturase polypeptide, or fragment thereof, has about three histidine motifs. \\n\\n    The constructs containing the desaturase genes can be used in any expression system including plants, animals, and microorganisms for the production of cells capable of producing LCPUFAs such as DHA, EPA, AA, SDA, and GLA. Examples of plants used for expressing the desaturases of the present invention include, among others, plants and plant seeds from oilseed crops, e.g., flax (Linum sp.), rapeseed (Brassica sp.), soybean (Glycine and Soja sp.), sunflower (Helianthus sp.), corron (Gossypium sp.), corn ( Zea mays ), olive (Olea sp.), safflower (Carthamus sp.), cocoa ( Theobroma cacoa ), and peanut (Arachis sp.). \\n\\n    In a related aspect, the present invention provides new and improved methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., LCPUFAs, and other key compounds of the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway using cells, e.g., plant cells, animal cells, and/or microbial cells in which the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway has been manipulated such that LCPUFAs or other desired unsaturated fatty acid compounds are produced. \\n\\n    The new and improved methodologies of the present invention include methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., DHA) in cells having at least one fatty acid desaturase of the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway manipulated such that unsaturated fatty acids are produced (e.g., produced at an increased level).

These novel molecules are members of the fatty acid desaturase family and are expressed in LCPUFAs-producing organisms, e.g., Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare, Schizichytrium, and Crythecodinium. \\n\\n    As used herein, the term fatty acids is art recognized and includes a long-chain hydrocarbon based carboxylic acid. Fatty acids are components of many lipids including glycerides. The most common naturally occurring fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids which have an even number of carbon atoms (16 or 18) and which may be saturated or unsaturated. Unsaturated fatty acids contain cis double bonds between the carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids encompassed by the present invention include, for example, DHA, GLA, and SDA. Polyunsaturated fatty acids contain more than one double bond and the double bonds are arranged in a methylene interrupted system (CHCHCH ‚ÇÇ CHCH). \\n\\n    Fatty acids are described herein by a numbering system in which the number before the colon indicates the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, whereas the number after the colon is the number of double bonds that are present. In the case of unsaturated fatty acids, this is followed by a number in parentheses that indicates the position of the double bonds. Each number in parenthesis is the lower numbered carbon atom of the two connected by the double bond. For example, oleic acid can be described as 18:1(9) and linoleic acid can be described as 18:2(9, 12) indicating 18 carbons, one double bond at carbon 9, two double bonds at carbons 9 and 12, respectively. \\n\\n    The controlling steps in the production of unsaturated fatty acids, i.e., the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, are catalyzed by membrane-associated fatty acid desaturases, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. As used herein, the term unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway refers to a series of chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of an unsaturated fatty acid either in vivo or in vitro. Such a pathway includes a series of desaturation and elongation steps which generate unsaturated fatty acids and ultimately, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Such unsaturated fatty acids can include, GLA 18:3 (6,9,12), SDA 18:4 (6,9,12,15), AA 20:4 (5,8,11,14), EPA 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17), and DPA 22:5 (4,7,10,13,16), and DHA 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19). \\n\\n    Desaturases can contain a heme-binding motif and/or about three conservative histidine motifs, although additional domains may be present. Members of the fatty acid desaturase family convert saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), which are components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). Examples of LCPUFA include, among others, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129-S138). DHA also has effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315-391). In addition, positive effects of DHA were also found in the treatment of diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211-215). Thus, the desaturase molecules can be used to produce the LCPUFAs useful in treating disorders characterized by aberrantly regulated growth, proliferation, or differentiation. Such disorders include cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, or leukemia; tumor angiogenesis and metastasis; skeletal dysplasia; hepatic disorders; myelodysplastic syndromes; and hematopoietic and/or myeloproliferative disorders. Other disorders related to angiogenesis and which are, therefore, desaturase associated disorders include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. \\n\\n    The term family when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention is intended to mean two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin or alternatively, can contain homologues of non-human origin, e.g., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. p For example, the family of desaturase proteins of the present invention comprises one cytochrome b5 heme-binding motif. As used herein, the term heme-binding motifis an N-terminal extension of the cytochrome b5-like domain found in front-end desaturases. \\n\\n    In another embodiment, members of the desaturase family of proteins include a histidine motifs in the protein, preferably, about three or four histidine motifs. As used herein, the term histidine motif includes a protein domain having at least about two histidine amino acid residues, preferably about three or four histidine amino acid residues, and is typically found in all microsomal desaturases as the third conservative histidine motif. \\n\\n    Examples of cytochrome b5 heme-binding motifs and histidine motifs include amino acid residues 41-44, 182-186, 216-223, and 453-462 of SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 40-43, 171-175, 207-213, and 375-384 of SEQ ID NO:5, amino acid residues 40-45, 171-176, 208-213, and 395-400 of SEQ ID NO:8, and amino acid residues 42-47, 178-183, 215-220, and 400-405 of SEQ ID NO: 11, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 6. \\n\\n    Isolated desaturase proteins of the present invention have an amino acid sequence sufficiently homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 or are encoded by a nucleotide sequence sufficiently homologous to SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. As used herein, the term sufficiently homologous refers to a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence which contains a sufficient or minimum number of identical or equivalent (e.g., an amino acid residue which has a similar side chain) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleotide sequences share common structural domains or motifs and/or a common functional activity. For example, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share common structural domains having at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity across the amino acid sequences of the domains and contain at least one and preferably two structural domains or motifs, are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. Furthermore, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity and share a common functional activity are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. \\n\\n    In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains or motifs: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif and has an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous or identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif, and is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one heme-binding motif and/or at least about three histidine motifs, and has a desaturase activity. \\n\\n    As used interchangeably herein, a desaturase activity, biological activity of a desaturase, or functional activity of a desaturase, includes an activity exerted or mediated by a desaturase protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on a desaturase responsive cell or on a desaturase substrate, as determined in vivo or in vitro, according to standard techniques. In one embodiment, a desaturase activity is a direct activity such as an association with a desaturase target molecule. As used herein, a target molecule or binding partner is a molecule e.g., a molecule involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, with which a desaturase protein binds or interacts in nature such that a desaturase-mediated function is achieved. A desaturase direct activity also includes the formation of a double bond between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule to form an unsaturated fatty acid molecule. \\n\\n    The nucleotide sequence of the isolated Thraustochytrium sp. 4 desaturase, Fad4, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad4 cDNA are shown in FIG. 1 and in SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad4 gene (the open reading frame), which is approximately 1560 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 59.1 kD and which is approximately 519 amino acid residues in length. \\n\\n    The nucleotide sequence of the Thraustochytrium sp. 5 desaturase, Fad5, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5 cDNA are shown in FIG. 2 and in SEQ ID NOs:3 and 4, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad5 gene, which is approximately 1320 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 49.8 kD and which is approximately 439 amino acid residues in length. \\n\\n    The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare 5 desaturase, Fad5-2, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5-2 cDNA are shown in FIG. 4 and in SEQ ID NOs:5 and 6, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad5-2 gene, which is approximately 1371 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 456 amino acid residues in length. \\n\\n    The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare 6 desaturase, Fad6, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad6 cDNA are shown in FIG. 5 and in SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad6 gene, which is approximately 1383 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 460 amino acid residues in length. \\n\\n    Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections: \\n\\n    I. Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules \\n\\n    One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode desaturase proteins or biologically active portions thereof, as well as nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify desaturase-encoding nucleic acid molecules (e.g., desaturase mRNA) and fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of desaturase nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term nucleic acid molecule is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. \\n\\n    The term isolated nucleic acid molecule includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term isolated includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5 and 3 ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated desaturase nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an isolated nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. \\n\\n    A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, e.g., a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, or a portion thereof, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information provided herein. Using all or a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, as hybridization probes, desaturase nucleic acid molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook, J. et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 ‚Åø·µà , ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). \\n\\n    Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule encompassing all or a portion of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, can be isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed based upon the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3,5,or 7. \\n\\n    A nucleic acid of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to desaturase nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. \\n\\n    In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule consists of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. \\n\\n    In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, or a portion of any of these nucleotide sequences. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 is one which is sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that it can hybridize to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby forming a stable duplex. \\n\\n    In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 (e.g., to the entire length of the nucleotide sequence), or a portion or complement of any of these nucleotide sequences. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least (or no greater than) 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-750, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. \\n\\n    Moreover, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, a fragment which can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding a portion of a desaturase protein, e.g., a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein. The nucleotide sequence determined from the cloning of the desaturase gene allows for the generation of probes and primers designed for use in identifying and/or cloning other desaturase family members, as well as desaturase homologues from other species. The probe/primer (e.g., oligonucleotide) typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 12 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 75 consecutive nucleotides of a sense sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, of an anti-sense sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or of a naturally occurring allelic variant or mutant of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. \\n\\n    Exemplary probes or primers are at least (or no greater than) 12 or 15, 20 or 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or more nucleotides in length and/or comprise consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein. Also included within the scope of the present invention are probes or primers comprising contiguous or consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein, but for the difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases within the probe or primer sequence. Probes based on the desaturase nucleotide sequences can be used to detect (e.g., specifically detect) transcripts or genomic sequences encoding the same or homologous proteins. In preferred embodiments, the probe further comprises a label group attached thereto, e.g., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. In another embodiment a set of primers is provided, e.g., primers suitable for use in a PCR, which can be used to amplify a selected region of a desaturase sequence, e.g., a domain, region, site or other sequence described herein. The primers should be at least 5, 10, or 50 base pairs in length and less than 100, or less than 200, base pairs in length. The primers should be identical, or differ by no greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases when compared to a sequence disclosed herein or to the sequence of a naturally occurring variant. Such probes can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissue which misexpress a desaturase protein, such as by measuring a level of a desaturase-encoding nucleic acid in a sample of cells from a subject, e.g., detecting desaturase mRNA levels or determining whether a genomic desaturase gene has been mutated or deleted. \\n\\n    A nucleic acid fragment encoding a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, which encodes a polypeptide having a desaturase biological activity (the biological activities of the desaturase proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the desaturase protein (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro) and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the desaturase protein. In an exemplary embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length and encodes a protein having a desaturase activity (as described herein). \\n\\n    The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same desaturase proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs by at least 1, but no greater than 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 amino acid residues from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the amino acid sequence of human desaturase. If an alignment is needed for this comparison, the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. \\n\\n    Nucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologues (different locus), and orthologues (different organism) or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product). \\n\\n    Allelic variants result, for example, from DNA sequence polymorphisms within a population (e.g., the human population) that lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the desaturase proteins. Such genetic polymorphism in the desaturase genes may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. \\n\\n    As used herein, the terms gene and recombinant gene refer to nucleic acid molecules which include an open reading frame encoding a desaturase protein, e.g., oilseed desaturase protein, and can further include non-coding regulatory sequences, and introns. \\n\\n    Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a naturally occurring allelic variant of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, wherein the nucleic acid molecule hybridizes to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions. \\n\\n    Allelic variants of desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, include both functional and non-functional desaturase proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein that maintain the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., a fatty acid, e.g., DHA); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. The fatty acids produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention are also useful in treating disorders such as aging, stress, diabetes, cancer, inflammatory disorders (e.g., arthritis, eczema), and cardiovascular disorders. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only a conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. \\n\\n    Non-functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, that do not have the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, such as 18:4 (6,9,12,15)); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. \\n\\n    The present invention further provides orthologues (e.g., human orthologues of the desaturase proteins). Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins are proteins that are isolated from other organisms and possess the same desaturase substrate or target molecule binding mechanisms, double bond forming mechanisms, modulating mechanisms of growth and development of the brain in infants, maintenance mechanisms of normal brain function in adults, ability to affect photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, ability to affect rhodopsin activation, development mechanisms of rods and/or cones, and/or modulating mechanisms of cellular growth and/or proliferation of the non-human desaturase proteins. Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins can readily be identified as comprising an amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. \\n\\n    Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other desaturase family embers and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, another desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins from different species, and which, thus, have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, Schizochytrium or Crythecodinium desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. \\n\\n    Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the desaturase cDNAs of the invention can be isolated based on their homology to the desaturase nucleic acids disclosed herein using the cDNAs disclosed herein, or a portion thereof, as a hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent hybridization conditions. \\n\\n    Orthologues, homologues and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art (e.g., by hybridization to an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions). In one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention is at least 15, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In other embodiment, the nucleic acid is at least 50-100, 100-250, 250-500, 500-700, 750-1000, 1000-1250, 1250-1500, 1500-1750, 1750-2000, 2000-2250, 2250-2500, 2500-2750, 2750-3000, 3250-3500, 3500-3750 or more nucleotides in length. \\n\\n    As used herein, the term hybridizes under stringent conditions is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences that are significantly identical or homologous to each other remain hybridized to each other. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% identical to each other remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1995), sections 2, 4, and 6. Additional stringent conditions can be found in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual , Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), chapters 7, 9, and 11. A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4 sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70 C. (or alternatively hybridization in 4 SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50 C.) followed by one or more washes in 1 SSC, at about 65-70 C. A preferred, non-limiting example of highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 1 SSC, at about 65-70 C. (or alternatively hybridization in 1 SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50 C.) followed by one or more washes in 0.3 SSC, at about 65-70 C. A preferred, non-limiting example of reduced stringency hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4 SSC, at about 50-60 C. (or alternatively hybridization in 6 SSC plus 50% formamide at about 40-45 C.) followed by one or more washes in 2 SSC, at about 50-60 C. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values, e.g., at 65-70 C. or at 42-50 C. are also intended to be encompassed by the present invention. SSPE (1 SSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10 mM NaH ‚ÇÇ PO ‚ÇÑ , and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1 SSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5-10 C. less than the melting temperature (T ‚Çò ) of the hybrid, where Tm is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T ‚Çò ( C.)2( of AT bases)4( of GC bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T ‚Çò ( C.)81.516.6(log ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ Na )0.41 (%GC)(600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and Na is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer (Na for 1 SSC0.165 M). It will also be recognized by the skilled practitioner that additional reagents may be added to hybridization and/or wash buffers to decrease non-specific hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to membranes, for example, nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, including but not limited to blocking agents (e.g., BSA or salmon or herring sperm carrier DNA), detergents (e.g., SDS), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA), Ficoll, PVP and the like. When using nylon membranes, in particular, an additional preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 0.25-0.5M NaH ‚ÇÇ PO ‚ÇÑ , 7% SDS at about 65 C., followed by one or more washes at 0.02M NaH ‚ÇÇ PO ‚ÇÑ , 1% SDS at 65 C. (see e.g., Church and Gilbert (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1991-1995), or alternatively 0.2 SSC, 1% SDS. \\n\\n    Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature (e.g., encodes a natural protein). \\n\\n    In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of the desaturase sequences that may exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by mutation into the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded desaturase proteins, without altering the functional ability of the desaturase proteins. For example, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at non-essential amino acid residues can be made in the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A non-essential amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 (e.g., the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11) without altering the biological activity, whereas an essential amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the desaturase proteins of the present invention, e.g., those present in a heme-binding motif or a histidine motif, are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. Furthermore, additional amino acid residues that are conserved between the desaturase proteins of the present invention and other members of the fatty acid desaturase family are not likely to be amenable to alteration. \\n\\n    Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such desaturase proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, yet retain biological activity. In one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, wherein the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% 99% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, e.g., to the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11. \\n\\n    An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a desaturase protein homologous to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a desaturase protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a desaturase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for desaturase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. \\n\\n    In a preferred embodiment, a mutant desaturase protein can be assayed for the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. \\n\\n    II. Isolated Desaturase Proteins \\n\\n    One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated or recombinant desaturase proteins and polypeptides, and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment, native desaturase proteins can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, desaturase proteins are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a desaturase protein or polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. \\n\\n    An isolated or purified protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the desaturase protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language substantially free of cellular material includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, or 30% (by dry weight) of non-desaturase protein (also referred to herein as a contaminating protein), more preferably less than about 20% of non-desaturase protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-desaturase protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-desaturase protein. When the desaturase protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. \\n\\n    The language substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals. It should be understood that the proteins or this invention can also be in a form which is different than their corresponding naturally occurring proteins and/or which is still in association with at least some cellular components. For example, the protein can be associated with a cellular membrane. \\n\\n    As used herein, a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein includes a fragment of a desaturase protein which participates in an interaction between a desaturase molecule and a non-desaturase molecule (e.g., a desaturase substrate such as fatty acid). Biologically active portions of a desaturase protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the desaturase amino acid sequences, e.g., the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11 which include sufficient amino acid residues to exhibit at least one activity of a desaturase protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the desaturase protein; the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. A biologically active portion of a desaturase protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200 or more amino acids in length. \\n\\n    In one embodiment, a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein comprises a heme-binding motif and/or at least one histidine motifs, preferably about three histidine motifs. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native desaturase protein. \\n\\n    In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In other embodiments, the desaturase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, yet differs in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. In another embodiment, the desaturase protein is a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. \\n\\n    In another embodiment, the invention features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. This invention further features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. \\n\\n    To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the length of the reference sequence (e.g., when aligning a second sequence to the Fad4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 having 519 amino acid residues, at least 156, preferably at least 208, more preferably at least 260, even more preferably at least 311, and even more preferably at least 363, 415, or 467 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 having 439 amino acid residues, at least 132, preferably at least 176, more preferably at least 220, even more preferably at least 263, and even more preferably at least 307, 351, or 395 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5-2 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 having 456 amino acid residues, at least 137, preferably at least 182, more preferably at least 228, even more preferably at least 273, and even more preferably at least 319, 365, or 419 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad6 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8 having 460 amino acid residues, at least 138, preferably at least 184, more preferably at least 230, even more preferably at least 276, and even more preferably at least 322, 368, or 414 amino acid residues are aligned). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid identity is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid homology). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. \\n\\n    The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch ( J. Mol. Biol. ( 48):444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A preferred, non-limiting example of parameters to be used in conjunction with the GAP program include a Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. \\n\\n    In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller ( Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:11-17 (1988)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0 or version 2.0U), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. \\n\\n    The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a query sequence to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score100, wordlength12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to desaturase nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score50, wordlength3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to desaturase protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389-3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. \\n\\n    III. Methods of Producing Unsaturated Fatty Acids \\n\\n    The present invention provides new and improved methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., LCPUFAs, such as, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 (n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 (n-6)), AA (Arachidonic acid, 20:4 (n-6)) and EPA (eicosapentaenioc acid, 20:5(n-3)). \\n\\n    A. Recombinant Cells and Methods for Culturing Cells \\n\\n    The present invention further features recombinant vectors that include nucleic acid sequences that encode the gene products as described herein, preferably Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 gene products. The term recombinant vector includes a vector (e.g., plasmid) that has been altered, modified or engineered such that it contains greater, fewer or different nucleic acid sequences than those included in the native vector or plasmid. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector includes the nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one fatty acid desaturase enzyme operably linked to regulatory sequences. The phrase operably linked to regulatory sequence(s) means that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression (e.g., enhanced, increased, constitutive, basal, attenuated, decreased or repressed expression) of the nucleotide sequence, preferably expression of a gene product encoded by the nucleotide sequence (e.g., when the recombinant vector is introduced into a cell). Exemplary vectors are described in further detail herein as well as in, for example, Frascotti et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,137, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. \\n\\n    The term regulatory sequence includes nucleic acid sequences which affect (e.g., modulate or regulate) expression of other (non-regulatory) nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence is included in a recombinant vector in a similar or identical position and/or orientation relative to a particular gene of interest as is observed for the regulatory sequence and gene of interest as it appears in nature, e.g., in a native position and/or orientation. For example, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to the gene in the natural organism (e.g., operably linked to native Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequence (e.g., to the native Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 promoter). Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to another (e.g., a different) gene in the natural organism. For example, a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene can be included in a vector operably linked to non-Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequences. Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence from another organism. For example, regulatory sequences from other microbes (e.g., other bacterial regulatory sequences, bacteriophage regulatory sequences and the like) can be operably linked to a particular gene of interest. \\n\\n    Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers, termination signals and other expression control elements (e.g., binding sites for transcriptional and/or translational regulatory proteins, for example, in the transcribed mRNA). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., constitutive promoters and strong constitutive promoters), those which direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., inducible promoters, for example, xylose inducible promoters) and those which attenuate or repress expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., attenuation signals or repressor sequences). It is also within the scope of the present invention to regulate expression of a gene of interest by removing or deleting regulatory sequences. For example, sequences involved in the negative regulation of transcription can be removed such that expression of a gene of interest is enhanced. \\n\\n    In one embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes nucleic acid sequences that encode at least one gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) operably linked to a promoter or promoter sequence. \\n\\n    In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes a terminator sequence or terminator sequences (e.g., transcription terminator sequences). The term terminator sequences includes regulatory sequences which serve to terminate transcription of mRNA. Terminator sequences (or tandem transcription terminators) can further serve to stabilize mRNA (e.g., by adding structure to MRNA), for example, against nucleases. \\n\\n    In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes antibiotic resistance sequences. The term antibiotic resistance sequences includes sequences which promote or confer resistance to antibiotics on the host organism. In one embodiment, the antibiotic resistance sequences are selected from the group consisting of cat (chloramphenicol resistance), tet (tetracycline resistance) sequences, erm (erythromycin resistance) sequences, neo (neomycin resistance) sequences and spec (spectinomycin resistance) sequences. Recombinant vectors of the present invention can further include homologous recombination sequences (e.g., sequences designed to allow recombination of the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host organism). For example, amyE sequences can be used as homology targets for recombination into the host chromosome. \\n\\n    The term manipulated cell includes a cell that has been engineered (e.g., genetically engineered) or modified such that the cell has at least one fatty acid desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6, such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced. Modification or engineering of such microorganisms can be according to any methodology described herein including, but not limited to, deregulation of a biosynthetic pathway and/or overexpression of at least one biosynthetic enzyme. A manipulated enzyme (e.g., a manipulated biosynthetic enzyme) includes an enzyme, the expression or production of which has been altered or modified such that at least one upstream or downstream precursor, substrate or product of the enzyme is altered or modified, for example, as compared to a corresponding wild-type or naturally occurring enzyme. \\n\\n    The term overexpressed or overexpression includes expression of a gene product (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase) at a level greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. In one embodiment, the cell can be genetically manipulated (e.g., genetically engineered) to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. Genetic manipulation can include, but is not limited to, altering or modifying regulatory sequences or sites associated with expression of a particular gene (e.g., by adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or by removing regulatory sequences such that expression is constitutive), modifying the chromosomal location of a particular gene, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to a particular gene such as a ribosome binding site or transcription terminator, increasing the copy number of a particular gene, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of a particular gene routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). \\n\\n    In another embodiment, the cell can be physically or environmentally manipulated to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. For example, a cell can be treated with or cultured in the presence of an agent known or suspected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. Alternatively, a cell can be cultured at a temperature selected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. \\n\\n    The term deregulated or deregulation includes the alteration or modification of at least one gene in a cell that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway, such that the level or activity of the biosynthetic enzyme in the cell is altered or modified. Preferably, at least one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the gene product is enhanced or increased. The phrase deregulated pathway can also include a biosynthetic pathway in which more than one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the level or activity of more than one biosynthetic enzyme is altered or modified. The ability to deregulate a pathway (e.g., to simultaneously deregulate more than one gene in a given biosynthetic pathway) in a cell arises from the particular phenomenon of cells in which more than one enzyme (e.g., two or three biosynthetic enzymes) are encoded by genes occurring adjacent to one another on a contiguous piece of genetic material termed an operon. \\n\\n    The term operon includes a coordinated unit of gene expression that contains a promoter and possibly a regulatory element associated with one or more, preferably at least two, structural genes (e.g., genes encoding enzymes, for example, biosynthetic enzymes). Expression of the structural genes can be coordinately regulated, for example, by regulatory proteins binding to the regulatory element or by anti-termination of transcription. The structural genes can be transcribed to give a single mRNA that encodes all of the structural proteins. Due to the coordinated regulation of genes included in an operon, alteration or modification of the single promoter and/or regulatory element can result in alteration or modification of each gene product encoded by the operon. Alteration or modification of the regulatory element can include, but is not limited to removing the endogenous promoter and/or regulatory element(s), adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or removing regulatory sequences such that expression of the gene products is modified, modifying the chromosomal location of the operon, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the operon or within the operon such as a ribosome binding site, increasing the copy number of the operon, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of the operon and/or translation of the gene products of the operon, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of genes routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). Deregulation can also involve altering the coding region of one or more genes to yield, for example, an enzyme that is feedback resistant or has a higher or lower specific activity. \\n\\n    A particularly preferred recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a plant-derived gene or gene product or an microorganismally-derived gene or gene product. The term plant-derived, microorganismally-derived, or derived-from, for example, includes a gene which is naturally found in a microorganism or a plant, e.g., an oilseed plant, or a gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) or which is encoded by a plant gene or a gene from a microorganism (e.g., encoded SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ IDNO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7). \\n\\n    The methodologies of the present invention feature recombinant cells which overexpress at least one fatty acid desaturase. In one embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Thrauschytrium sp. fatty acid desaturase (e.g., has been engineered to overexpress at least one of Thrauschytrium sp. 4 or 5 desaturase (the Fad4 or Fad5 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or 4 or encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3). \\n\\n    In another embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Pythium irregulare 5 or 6 desaturase (the Fad5-2 or Fad6 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8 or encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 or 5). \\n\\n    In another embodiment, the invention features a cell (e.g., a microbial cell) that has been transformed with a vector comprising a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1,3,5, or 7). \\n\\n    Another aspect of the present invention features a method of modulating the production of fatty acids comprising culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., a desaturase) such that modulation of fatty acid production occurs (e.g., production of unsaturated fatty acids is enhanced). The method of culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g. Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6) to modulate the production of fatty acids is referred to herein as biotransformation. The biotransformation processes can utilize recombinant cells and/or desaturases described herein. The term biotransformation process, also referred to herein as bioconversion processes, includes biological processes which result in the production (e.g., transformation or conversion) of any compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is upstream of a fatty acid desaturase to a compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is downstream of a fatty acid desaturase, in particular, an unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of an unsaturated fatty acid comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses at least one fatty acid desaturase with at least one appropriate substrate under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced and, optionally, recovering the fatty acid. In a preferred embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of unsaturated fatty acids comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 with an appropriate substrate (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid) under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA, SDA, or GLA) is produced and, optionally, recovering the unsaturated fatty acid. Conditions under which an unsaturated fatty acid is produced can include any conditions which result in the desired production of an unsaturated fatty acid. \\n\\n    The cell(s) and/or enzymes used in the biotransformation reactions are in a form allowing them to perform their intended function (e.g., producing a desired fatty acids). The cells can be whole cells, or can be only those portions of the cells necessary to obtain the desired end result. The cells can be suspended (e.g., in an appropriate solution such as buffered solutions or media), rinsed (e.g., rinsed free of media from culturing the cell), acetone-dried, immobilized (e.g., with polyacrylamide gel or k-carrageenan or on synthetic supports, for example, beads, matrices and the like), fixed, cross-linked or permeablized (e.g., have permeablized membranes and/or walls such that compounds, for example, substrates, intermediates or products can more easily pass through said membrane or wall). The type of cell can be any cell capable of being used within the methods of the invention, e.g., plant, animal, or microbial cells. \\n\\n    An important aspect of the present invention involves growing the recombinant plant or culturing the recombinant microorganisms described herein, such that a desired compound (e.g., a desired unsaturated fatty acid) is produced. The term culturing includes maintaining and/or growing a living microorganism of the present invention (e.g., maintaining and/or growing a culture or strain). In one embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in liquid media. In another embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in solid media or semi-solid media. In a preferred embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in media (e.g., a sterile, liquid media) comprising nutrients essential or beneficial to the maintenance and/or growth of the microorganism (e.g., carbon sources or carbon substrate, for example complex carbohydrates such as bean or grain meal, starches, sugars, sugar alcohols, hydrocarbons, oils, fats, fatty acids, organic acids and alcohols; nitrogen sources, for example, vegetable proteins, peptones, peptides and amino acids derived from grains, beans and tubers, proteins, peptides and amino acids derived form animal sources such as meat, milk and animal byproducts such as peptones, meat extracts and casein hydrolysates; inorganic nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate; phosphorus sources, for example, phosphoric acid, sodium and potassium salts thereof; trace elements, for example, magnesium, iron, manganese, calcium, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum, and/or cobalt salts; as well as growth factors such as amino acids, vitamins, growth promoters and the like). \\n\\n    Preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled pH. The term controlled pH includes any pH which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of about 7. In another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.5. The desired pH may be maintained by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art. \\n\\n    Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled aeration. The term controlled aeration includes sufficient aeration (e.g., oxygen) to result in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, aeration is controlled by regulating oxygen levels in the culture, for example, by regulating the amount of oxygen dissolved in culture media. Preferably, aeration of the culture is controlled by agitating the culture. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the growth vessel (e.g., fermentor) or by various pumping equipment. Aeration may be further controlled by the passage of sterile air or oxygen through the medium (e.g., through the fermentation mixture). Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured without excess foaming (e.g., via addition of antifoaming agents). \\n\\n    Moreover, plants or microorganisms of the present invention can be cultured under controlled temperatures. The term controlled temperature includes any temperature which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15 C. and 95 C. In another embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15 C. and 70 C. Preferred temperatures are between 20 C. and 55 C., more preferably between 30 C. and 45 C. or between 30 C. and 50 C. \\n\\n    Microorganisms can be cultured (e.g., maintained and/or grown) in liquid media and preferably are cultured, either continuously or intermittently, by conventional culturing methods such as standing culture, test tube culture, shaking culture (e.g., rotary shaking culture, shake flask culture, etc.), aeration spinner culture, or fermentation. In a preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in shake flasks. In a more preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in a fermentor (e.g., a fermentation process). Fermentation processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, batch, fed-batch and continuous methods of fermentation. The phrase batch process or batch fermentation refers to a closed system in which the composition of media, nutrients, supplemental additives and the like is set at the beginning of the fermentation and not subject to alteration during the fermentation, however, attempts may be made to control such factors as pH and oxygen concentration to prevent excess media acidification and/or microorganism death. The phrase fed-batch process or fed-batch fermentation refers to a batch fermentation with the exception that one or more substrates or supplements are added (e.g., added in increments or continuously) as the fermentation progresses. The phrase continuous process or continuous fermentation refers to a system in which a defined fermentation media is added continuously to a fermentor and an equal amount of used or conditioned media is simultaneously removed, preferably for recovery of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). A variety of such processes have been developed and are well-known in the art. \\n\\n    The phrase culturing under conditions such that a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid, for example, DHA) is produced includes maintaining and/or growing plants or microorganisms under conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, duration, etc.) appropriate or sufficient to obtain production of the desired compound or to obtain desired yields of the particular compound being produced. For example, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to produce the desired amount of a unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA). Preferably, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to substantially reach maximal production of the unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, culturing is continued for about 12 to 24 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for about 24 to 36 hours, 36 to 48 hours, 48 to 72 hours, 72 to 96 30 hours, 96 to 120 hours, 120 to 144 hours, or greater than 144 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to reach production yields of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, cells are cultured such that at least about 15 to 20 g/L of unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 20 to 25 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 25 to 30 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at 35 least about 30 to 35 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 35 to 40 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced (e.g., at least about 37 g/L unsaturated fatty acids) or at least about 40 to 50 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced. In yet another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured under conditions such that a preferred yield of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, a yield within a range set forth above, is produced in about 24 hours, in about 36 hours, in about 48 hours, in about 72 hours, or in about 96 hours. \\n\\n    In producing unsaturated fatty acids, it may further be desirable to culture cells of the present invention in the presence of supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates. The term supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrate includes an agent or compound which, when brought into contact with a cell or included in the culture medium of a cell, serves to enhance or increase unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added in the form of a concentrated solution or suspension (e.g., in a suitable solvent such as water or buffer) or in the form of a solid (e.g., in the form of a powder). Moreover, supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added as a single aliquot, continuously or intermittently over a given period of time. \\n\\n    The methodology of the present invention can further include a step of recovering a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). The term recovering a desired compound includes extracting, harvesting, isolating or purifying the compound from culture media. Recovering the compound can be performed according to any conventional isolation or purification methodology known in the art including, but not limited to, treatment with a conventional resin (e.g, anion or cation exchange resin, non-ionic adsorption resin, etc.), treatment with a conventional adsorbent (e.g., activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina, etc.), alteration of pH, solvent extraction (e.g., with a conventional solvent such as an alcohol, ethyl acetate, hexane and the like), dialysis, filtration, concentration, crystallization, recrystallization, pH adjustment, lyophilization and the like. For example, a compound can be recovered from culture media by first removing the microorganisms from the culture. Media is then passed through or over a cation exchange resin to remove unwanted cations and then through or over an anion exchange resin to remove unwanted inorganic anions and organic acids having stronger acidities than the unsaturated fatty acid of interest (e.g., DHA). \\n\\n    Preferably, a desired compound of the present invention is extracted, isolated or purified such that the resulting preparation is substantially free of other components (e.g., free of media components and/or fermentation byproducts). The language substantially free of other components includes preparations of desired compound in which the compound is separated (e.g., purified or partially purified) from media components or fermentation byproducts of the culture from which it is produced. In one embodiment, the preparation has greater than about 80% (by dry weight) of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 20% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), more preferably greater than about 90% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 10% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), still more preferably greater than about 95% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 5% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), and most preferably greater than about 98-99% desired compound (e.g., less than about 1-2% other media components or fermentation byproducts). When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to a salt, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the salt. When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to an alcohol, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the alcohol. \\n\\n    In an alternative embodiment, the desired unsaturated fatty acid is not purified from the plant or microorganism, for example, when the plant or microorganism is biologically non-hazardous (e.g., safe). For example, the entire plant or culture (or culture supernatant) can be used as a source of product (e.g., crude product). In one embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) supernatant is used without modification. In another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is concentrated. In yet another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is pulverized, dried, or lyophilized. \\n\\n    B. High Yield Production Methodologies \\n\\n    A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention is a high yield production method for producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., DHA, comprising culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that the unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a significantly high yield. The phrase high yield production method, for example, a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) includes a method that results in production of the desired compound at a level which is elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods. Preferably, a high yield production method results in production of the desired compound at a significantly high yield. The phrase significantly high yield includes a level of production or yield which is sufficiently elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods, for example, which is elevated to a level sufficient for commercial production of the desired product (e.g., production of the product at a commercially feasible cost). In one embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 2 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 10 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 20 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 40 g/L. \\n\\n    The invention further features a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) that involves culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that a sufficiently elevated level of compound is produced within a commercially desirable period of time. In an exemplary embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 15-20 g/L in 36 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 25-30 g/L in 48 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 35-40 g/L in 72 hours, for example, greater that 37 g/L in 72 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30-40 g/L in 60 hours, for example, greater that 30, 35 or 40 g/L in 60 hours. Values and ranges included and/or intermediate within the ranges set forth herein are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention. For example, unsaturated fatty acid production at levels of at least 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 g/L in 60 hours are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. In another example, ranges of 30-35 g/L or 35-40 g/L are intended to be included within the range of 30-40 g/L in 60 hours. Moreover, the skilled artisan will appreciate that culturing a manipulated microorganism to achieve a production level of, for example, 30-40 g/L in 60 hours includes culturing the microorganism for additional time periods (e.g., time periods longer than 60 hours), optionally resulting in even higher yields of an unsaturated fatty acid being produced. \\n\\n    IV. Compositions \\n\\n    The desaturase nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and fragments thereof, of the invention can be used to produce unsaturated fatty acids which can be incorporated into compositions. Compositions of the present invention include, e.g., compositions for use as animal feed, compositions for use as neutraceuticals (e.g., dietary supplements), and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. \\n\\n    Such pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise an unsaturated fatty acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifingal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. \\n\\n    A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. \\n\\n    Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; \\n\\n    antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. \\n\\n    Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. \\n\\n    Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a LCPUFA, or a fragment thereof, produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. \\n\\n    Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. \\n\\n    For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g, a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. \\n\\n    Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. \\n\\n    The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. \\n\\n    In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. \\n\\n    It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. \\n\\n    Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. \\n\\n    The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. \\n\\n    As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. \\n\\n    In a preferred example, a subject is treated with a LCPUFA in the range of between about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody, protein, or polypeptide used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent from the results of diagnostic assays as described herein. \\n\\n    The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. \\n\\n    This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the figures, are incorporated herein by reference. \\n\\nEXAMPLES \\n\\n    Materials: \\n\\n    Thraustochytrium s.p ATCC 21685 and Pythium irregulare were purchased from American type culture collection (12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., 20852 USA) and grown in a medium (Weete, J. D., et al. (1997) Lipids 32:839-845) at 24 C. for 7days. After then biomass were harvested by centrifugation and used for RNA isolation. \\n\\nExample 1 \\n\\nConstruction and Screening of cDNA Library \\n\\n    Total RNA was isolated from the above materials according to Qiu and Erickson (Qiu, X. and Eriekson, L. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. Repr. 12:209-214). The cDNA library was constructed from the total RNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase from Gibco-BRL. The second strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I from Stratagene. After size fractionation, cDNA inserts larger than 1 kb were ligated into Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene). The recombinant DNAs were then packed with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) and plated on NZY plates. The resulting library represented more than 5106 independent clones. Screening of the cDNA library was performed according to standard methods (Sambrook, J, Fritseh, E. F., Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular cloningA laboratory manual. (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA.) \\n\\nExample 2 \\n\\nRT-PCR \\n\\n    The single strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) from total RNA and was then used as the template for PCR reaction with two degenerate primers (The forward primer: GCXCA/GAXGAXCAC/TCCXGGXGG and the reverse primer: ATXTG/TXGGA/GAAXAG/AG/ATGG/ATG). The PCR amplification consisted of 35 cycles with 1 min at 94 C., 1.5 min at 55 C. and 2 min at 72 C. followed by an extension step at 72 C. for 10 min. The amplified products from 800 bp to 1000 bp were isolated from agarose gel and purified by a kit (Qiaex II gel purification, Qiagen), and subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were then sequenced by PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). \\n\\nExample 3 \\n\\nExpression of FAD4, FAD5, FAD5-2, and FAD6 in Yeast \\n\\n    The open reading frames of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 were amplified by PCR using the Precision Plus enzyme (Stratagene) and cloned into a TA cloning vector (pCR2.1, Invitrogen). Having confirmed that the PCR products were identical to the original cDNAs by sequencing, the fragments were then released by a BarnHI-EcoRI double digestion and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the inducible promoter GAL. \\n\\n    Yeast strains InvSc2 (Invitrogen) was transformed with the expression constructs using the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil (Gietz, D., et al.

(1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226). \\n\\n    Transformants were first grown in minimal medium lacking uracil and containing glucose at 28 C. After overnight culture, the cells were spun down, washed and resuspended in distilled water. Minimal medium containing 2% galactose, with or without 0.3 mM substrate fatty acids in the presence of 0.1% tergitol, was inoculated with the yeast transformant cell suspension and incubated at 20 C. for three days, and then 15 C. for another three days. \\n\\nExample 4 \\n\\nFatty Acid Analysis \\n\\n    Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare and yeast cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water. Then 2 mL methanolic KOH (7.5% w/v KOH in 95% methanol) was added to the materials and the mixture sealed in a 12 ml glass culture tube was heated to 80 C. for 2 hours. 0.5 mL water was added and the sample was extracted twice with 2 mL hexane to remove the non-saponifiable lipids. The remaining aqueous phase was then acidified by adding 1 mL 6 N HCl and extracted twice with 2 mL hexane. The hexane phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. 2 mL 3 N methanolic HCl (SUPELCO, Supelco Park, Bellefonte, Pa. 16823-0048) was added and the mixture was heated at 80 C. for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL 0.9% NaCl was added and the mixture extracted twice with 22 mL hexane. The combined hexane was evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS according to Covello & Reed (Covello, P. S. and Reed, D. W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223-226). \\n\\n    GC/MS analysis was performed in standard El mode using a Fisons VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, UK) controlled by Masslynx version 2.0 software, coupled to a GC 8000 Series gas chromatograph. A DB-23 column (30M0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 Ilm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, Calif.) that was temperature-programmed at 180 C. for 1 min, then 4 C /min to 240 C. and held for 15 minutes, was used for FAME analysis. \\n\\nExample 5 \\n\\nTransformation of Brassica Juncea and Flax (Linum Usitatissimum) and Exogenous Fatty Acid Treatment \\n\\n    The hypocotyls of 5-6 day seedlings of B. juncea and flax were used as explants for inoculation with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens that hosts binary vectors with the full-length cDNAs under the control of the different promoters. The 20-day transgenic seedlings were used for exogenous fatty acid treatment. The seedling was divided into three parts: leaves, stems and roots. Each was cut into the small pieces and placed in a 24-well titer plate. To each well, 2 mL 0.05% sodium salt of substrates (NuCheck Prep Inc., Elysian, Minn.) was added. The plate was then incubated at 24 C. for 4 h with gentle shaking. After incubation, the plant tissues were washed three times with water and then used for fatty acid analysis. \\n\\nExample 6 \\n\\nFatty Acid Profile of the Thrauschytrium Sp. \\n\\n    Thraustochytrium and Pythium irregulare have recently drawn scientific attention due to its ability in production of LCPUFAs such as DHA, AA, EPA and DPA. FIGS. 15 and 16 show the fatty acid composition of the lipids isolated from 7 day cultures of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , respectively. As shown in the tables, the microorganisms contain a broad range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from both n-3 and n-6 families, from 18-carbon A6 fatty acids (gamma-linolenic acid and steardonic acid) to 22-carbon 4 fatty acids (DHA and DPA). The organisms, especially Thraustochytrium sp., appear to contain a full-set of desaturation and elongation enzymes required for the DHA and DPA biosynthesis. The strain lacks 24-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, the proposed precursors for DHA and DPA synthesis in Precher's pathway (Voss, A., et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:19995-20000; Mohammed, B.S., et al. (1997) Biochem. J. 326:425-430). The 24-carbon fatty acid may not be involved in in vivo synthesis of 22-carbon A4 fatty acids such as DHA and DPA in Thraustochytrium sp. \\n\\nExample 7 \\n\\nIdentification of cDNAS Coding for the Front-End Desaturase \\n\\n    To identify genes coding for desaturases involved in biosynthesis of LCFUFAs in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , a PCR-based cloning strategy was adopted. Two degenerate primers are designed to target the heme-binding motif of N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in front-end desaturases and the third conservative histidine motif in all microsomal desaturases, respectively. The rational behind the design is that the desaturases involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , should have similar primary structure as other front-end desaturases, i.e. N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in the desaturase. Four cDNAs fragments were identified from Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare that encode fusion proteins containing cyt b5-like domain in the N-terminus. \\n\\n    To isolate full-length cDNA clones, the four inserts were used as probes to screen cDNA libraries of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , which resulted in identification of several cDNA clones in each group. Sequencing of all those clones identified four full-length cDNAs which were named as Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2 and Fad6. The open reading frame of Fad4 is 1560 bp and codes for 519 amino acids with molecular weight of 59.1 kDa ( FIG. 1 ). Fad5 is 1230 bp in length and codes for 439 amino acids with molecular weight of 49.8 kDa ( FIG. 2 ). A sequence comparison of these two sequences from Thraustochytrium sp. showed only 16% amino acid identity between the deduced proteins. A detailed analysis revealed that Fad4 is 80 amino acids longer than Fad5, occurring between the second and third conservative histidine motifs ( FIG. 3 ). The open reading frame of Fad5-2 from Pythium irregulare is 1371 bp and codes for 456 amino acids ( FIG. 4 ). Fad6 from Pythium irregulare is 1383 bp in length and codes for 460 amino acids ( FIG. 5 ). Sequence comparison of the two sequences from Pythium irregulare showed over 39% similarity between the deduced proteins ( FIG. 6 ). \\n\\n    A BLASTP search of the protein database revealed the following hits 10 for each of the four proteins, Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6: \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFad 4 (519 amino acid residues) \\nBlastp nr \\nAccession \\nNo. Organism Description Length % Identity \\n\\nAF067654 Mortierella alpina 5 fatty acid 509 29 \\ndesaturase \\nAF054824 Mortierella alpina 5 microsomal 509 28 \\ndesaturase \\nAB022097 Dictyostelium 5 fatty acid 507 27 \\ndiscoideum desaturase \\nAB029311 Dictyostelium fatty acid 519 26 \\ndiscoideum desaturase \\nL11421 Synechocystis sp. 6 desaturase 410 25 \\nD90914 \\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFad 5 (439 amino acid residues) \\nBlastp nr \\nAccession No. Organism Description Length % Identity \\n\\nAF139720 Euglena gracilis 8 fatty acid 404 29 \\ndesaturase \\nAF007561 Borago officinalis 6 desaturase 421 27 \\nU79010 Borago officinalis 6 desaturase 421 27 \\nAF309556 Danio rerio 6 fatty acid 422 26 \\ndesaturase \\nAF110510 Mortierella 6 fatty acid 463 25 \\nalpina desaturase \\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFad 5-2 (456 amino acid residues) \\nBlastp nr \\nAccession No. Organism Description Length % Identity \\n\\nAB029311 Dictostelium Fatty acid 443 41 \\ndiscoideum desaturase \\nAB022097 Dictostelium 5 fatty acid 445 39 \\ndiscoideum desaturase \\nAF067654 Mortierella 5 fatty acid 441 38 \\nalpina desaturase \\nAF054824 Mortierella 5 microsomal 441 38 \\nalpina desaturase \\nL11421 Synechocystis sp. 6 desaturase 361 28 \\nD90914 \\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFad 6 (459 amino acid residues) \\nBlastp nr \\nAccession No. Organism Description Length % Identity \\n\\nAF110510 Mortierella 6 fatty acid 437 38 \\nalpina desaturase \\nAB020032 Mortierella 6 fatty acid 437 38 \\nalpina desaturase \\nAF306634 Mortierella 6 fatty acid 437 38 \\nisabellina desaturase \\nAF307940 Mortierella 6 fatty acid 438 38 \\nalpina desaturase \\nAJ250735 Ceratodon 6 fatty acid 438 36 \\npurpureus desaturase \\n\\n\\n   \\n\\nExample 8 \\n\\nExpression of FAD4, FAD5, FAD5-2, and FAD6 in Yeast \\n\\n    To confirm the function of Fad4, the full-length cDNA was expressed in the yeast strain InvSc2 under the control of the inducible promoter. FIG. 7 shows that with supplementation of the medium with 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19), yeast cells containing Fad4 cDNA had an extra fatty acid as compared to the vector control. The peak has a retention time identical to the DHA standard. LC/MS analysis of the free fatty acid showed that it yields deprotonated molecular ions (m/z279) identical to the DHA standard in negative ion electrospray. Moreover, GC/MS analysis of the FAME confirmed that the spectrum of the peak is identical to that of the DHA standard ( FIG. 8 ). These results indicate that Fad4 is a 4 fatty acid desaturase which is able to introduce a double bond at position 4 of the 22:5(7,10,13,16,19) substrate, resulting in a 4 desaturated fatty acid, DHA (22:6-4,7,10,13,16,19). \\n\\n    To further study the substrate specificity of the Fad4, a number of substrates including 18:2(9,12), 18:3(9,12,15), 20:3(8,11,14) and 22:4(7,10,13,16) were separately supplied to the yeast transformants. The results indicated Fad4 could also use 22:4 (7,10,13,16) as a substrate ( FIG. 9 ) to produce another 4 desaturated fatty acid, DPA (22:5-4,7,10,13,16) ( FIG. 10 ). The rest of the fatty acids examined were not effective substrates. \\n\\n    To confirm the function of Fad5 and Fad5-2, the S. cerevisiae Invsc2 was transformed with plasmids, which contain the open reading frame of the Fad5 and Fad5-2 respectively under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter. When the yeast transformants were induced by galactose in a medium containing homo-gamma-linolenic acid (HGLA, 20:3-8,11,14), an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 11 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the fatty acid had a retention time identical to the arachidonic acid standard (AA, 20:4-5,8,11,14). To further confirm the regiochemistry of the products, the FAMEs were analyzed by GC/MS. FIG. 12 indicates that the mass spectra of the new fatty acid and the AA standard are identical. These results demonstrate that Fad5 and Fad5-2 convert HGLA (20:3-8,11,13) into AA (20:4-5,8,11,14) in yeast. \\n\\n    To further study the substrate specificity of Fad5-2, the plasmid containing Fad5-2 was transferred into another yeast strain AMY-2 where ole1, a 9 desaturase gene, is disrupted. The strain is unable to grow in minimal media without supplementation with mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In this experiment, the strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 17:1(10Z), a non-substrate of Fad5-2, which enabled study of the specificity of the enzyme towards various substrates, especially monounsaturates. A number of possible substrates including 16:1(9Z), 18:1(9Z), 18:1(11Z), 18:1(11E), 18:1(12E), 18:1(15Z), 18:2(9Z,12Z), 18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z), 20:2(11Z,14Z) and 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) were tested. Results indicated that Fad5-2 could desaturate unsaturated fatty acids with 9 ethylenic and 11 ethylenic double bonds, as well as the fatty acid with 8 ethylenic double bond (20:3-8,11,14). As shown in FIG. 13 , Fad5-2 effectively converted both 18:1 (9Z) and 18:1 (11Z) substrates into their corresponding 5 desaturated fatty acids, 18:2-5,9 (the retention time 10.34 min) and 18:1-5,11 (the retention time 10.44 min), respectively. Fad5-2 also desaturated trans fatty acid such as 18:1(11E) and 18:1(12E). \\n\\n   FIG. 25 is a comparison of substrate preference of Fad5-2 for fatty acid substrates tested in the yeast strain AMY-2. The relative proportions of the substrates and the products accumulated are a useful indicator of substrate preference of the enzyme. As shown in FIG. 25 , Fad5-2 prefers fatty acids with 20-carbon as substrates, such as 20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z), 20:3(11Z,14Z, 17Z) and 20:2(11Z,14Z). Whereas, the shorter chain fatty acid is a relatively weaker substrate for the enzyme in yeast. \\n\\n    To confirm the function of Fad6, the S. cerevisiae host strain Invsc2 was transformed with a plasmid containing the open reading frame of Fad6 under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter, GAL1. When the yeast transformant was induced by galactose in a medium containing linoleic acid, an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of the FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 14 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the peak had a retention time identical to the gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3-6,9,12) standard. To confirm the regioselectivity of the products, the diethylamine derivatives of fatty acids from the expressing strain were analyzed by GC-MS. FIG. 15 shows that the new peak is indeed GLA with three double bonds at the A6, A9, and A12 positions. Major fragments of n and n1 carbons differing by 12 D are diagnostic of a double bond between carbon n1 and n2. Thus, the fragments at 156 and 168, 196 and 208, and 236 and 248, indicate double bonds at the 6, 9, and 12 positions, respectively. These results demonstrate that Fad6 is a 6 desaturase that converts linoleic acid (18:2) to GLA in yeast. \\n\\nExample 9 \\n\\n Expression OF FAD4 in B. juncea \\n\\n    To determine whether Traustochytrium Fad4 is functional in oilseed crops, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad4 under the control of a constitutive promoter. Eight independent transgenic plants were obtained. In B. juncea there is no 4 fatty acid desaturase substrates available. Thus, to examine the activity of the transgenic enzyme in the plants, the 22:5 (n-3) substrate must be exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium docosapentaeneate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of both types of plants, but converted into DHA only in transgenics. Leaves have a higher level of production of DHA than roots and stems. In leaves, the exogenous substrate was incorporated to a level of 10-20% of the total fatty acids and 4 desaturated fatty acid (22:6, n-3) was produced in a range of 3-6% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 16 ). These results indicate that the 4 fatty acid desaturase from Traustochytrium is functional in oilseed crops. \\n\\nExample 10 \\n\\n Expression of Fad5-2 in B. juncea \\n\\n    To determine whether Fad5-2 is functional in oilseed crops and its expression has any effect on their growth and development, B. juncea were transformed with a binary vector that contained Fad5-2 cDNA behind a constitutive promoter (a tandem cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter). Six independent primary transgenic plants were obtained and the fatty acid profile of lipids from different tissues was determined. FIG. 17 shows the fatty acid composition of three-week-old seedling plants from one T ‚ÇÅ line. Compared with wild type, all transgenic plant tissues have an altered fatty acid profile containing four additional peaks which were identified as four different 5-undesaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids (5-UPIFAs), specifically, taxoleic (18:2-5,9); ephedrenic (18:2-5,11); pinolenic (18:3-5,9,12), and coniferonic acids (18:4-5,9,12,15). Thus B. juncea , like yeast, can functionally express the P. irregulare 5 desaturase to convert the endogenous substrates 18:1-9; 18:1-11; 18:2-9,12, and 18:3-9,12,15 to the corresponding 5 desaturated fatty acids. The roots produced the highest amount of the 5-UPIFAs, representing more than 20% of the total fatty acids, followed by 6% in stems and 5% in leaves ( FIG. 17 ). \\n\\n    In B. juncea there is no homo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3-8,11,14) substrate available. Thus, to examine whether the transgenic plant can produce AA, the substrate 20:3(8,11,14) was exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium homo-gamma-linolenate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of transgenic plants and converted into AA in plants ( FIG. 18 ). \\n\\n    There was no observable phenotypic effect on the growth and development in the transgenic B. juncea , although the A5-UPIFAs accumulated in all parts of the plant. Growth and differentiation of vegetative tissues such as the leaves, stems, and roots were indistinguishable from the corresponding wild type. \\n\\n    To produce 5 desaturated fatty acids in seeds, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad5-2 cDNA behind a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Fatty acid analysis of transgenic seeds showed that there were two new fatty acids appearing in the gas chromatogram of transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 19 ). They were identified as taxoleic acid (18:2-5,9) and pinolenic acids (18:3-5,9,12). Together, these fatty acids represent 9.4% of the seed fatty acids. Accumulation of 5-UPIFAs has no significant effect on the oleic acid content compared with the untransformed control. \\n\\nExample 11 \\n\\nExpression of Fad5-2 in Flax \\n\\n    To produce 5 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, flax was transformed with Fad5-2 under the control of two seed-specific promoters, a heterologous B. napus napin promoter, and a flax endogenous promoter. As shown in FIG. 26 , transgenic plants containing the napin promoter produced one 5 desaturated fatty acid, taxoleic acid in seeds at the level of less than 1% of the total fatty acids. Whereas transgenic plants containing the flax seed-specific promoter produced three 5 desaturated fatty acids: taxoleic, pinolenic, and coniferonic acid. Of these, taxoleic (18:2-5,9) was the most abundant and accounted for more than 9% of the total fatty acids in a elite line (FN-10-1), followed by coniferonic and pinolenic acids. Surprisingly, accumulation of 5 desaturated fatty acids in transgenic seeds has significant impact on the composition of other fatty acids, especially the oleic acid level. Accumulation of 5-UPIFAs was accompanied by a huge increase of the oleic acids in both types of transgenic plants expressing Fad5-2 desaturase under the control of the different promoters. The content of oleic acid in transgenic plants with the napin and flax seed-specific promoters, on the average, reached 44.7% and 24.3% of the total fatty acids, respectively, relative to the untransformed control at 17.4%. \\n\\nExample 12 \\n\\nExpression of Fad6 in Flax \\n\\n    To produce 6 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, two types of flax were transformed with the construct that contains Fad6 cDNA under the control of a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Type I flax (Normandy) is a traditional industrial oilseed crop, whereas Type II (Solin) is an edible oilseed crop derived from chemical mutagenesis of Type I. A total of twelve transgenic plants were produced. The majority of transgenics exhibited two novel fatty acids whose retention times correspond to GLA and SDA and they constitute 0.1 to 4.3% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 27 ). The level of GLA in transgenic Solin type is higher than that of SDA, while GLA in transgenic Normandy is lower than SDA. This is understandable because linoleic acid is a major fatty acid in Solin type linseed while -linolenic acid is a major fatty acid in Normandy seeds. \\n\\nExample 13 \\n\\n Expression of Fad6 in B. juncea \\n\\n    To produce 6 desaturated fatty acids in seeds of B. juncea, B. juncea were transformed with the same construct used in flax transformation, i.e., Fad6 under the control of the B. napus napin promoter. Fifteen independent transgenic plants were obtained. Fatty acid analysis of the transgenic seeds showed that there were three new fatty acids in the gas chromatogram of most transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 20 ). The three fatty acids were identified as 18:2(6,9) and 18:3(6,9,12), and 18:4(6,9,12,15). B. juncea , like flax, can also flnctionally express Fad6 from P. irregulare , introducing a double bond at position 6 of endogenous substrate 18:1(9), 18:2(9,12), and 18:3(6,9,12) resulting in production of three corresponding 6 fatty acids in the transgenic seeds. Among the three new fatty acids produced in transgenic seeds, GLA is the most abundant one, with a level in transgenic seeds of 30% to 38% of the total fatty acids. The next most abundant component is SDA, which accounts for 3-10% of the total fatty acids in several transgenic lines ( FIG. 21 ). \\n\\n    The fatty acid compositions of transgenic seeds are shown in FIG. 22 . It is clear that the high level production of 6 desaturated fatty acids is at the cost of two major fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acids. Proportions of oleic and stearic acids in transgenics are slightly reduced, but not significantly compared to those in the wild type control. The content of linoleic acid in the transgenics was dramatically reduced. In the untransformed wild type, linoleic acid accounts for more than 40% of the total fatty acids in seeds. In transgenics, the level was reduced to less than 10%. As compared to the reduction of linoleic acid in transgenics, the decrease in linolenic acid in transgenics is less dramatic, but still significant. In the untransformed wild type, linolenic acid accounts for more than 10% of the total fatty acids in seeds while in transgenics the level was reduced to less than 5%. The two dramatically reduced fatty acids in transgenic seeds are the substrates of the 6 desaturase, and the reduction is the cost for producing two corresponding 6 desaturated fatty acids. \\n\\n    Equivalents \\n\\n    Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein.

The entire contents of all references cited therein also are expressly incorporated by reference and are intended to be part of the present application. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fatty acids are carboxylic acids with long-chain hydrocarbon side groups and play a fundamental role in many biological processes. Fatty acids are rarely free in nature but, rather, occur in esterified form as the major component of lipids. Lipids/fatty acids are sources of energy (e.g., b-oxidation) and are an integral part of cell membranes which are indispensable for processing biological or biochemical information. Fatty acids can be divided into two groups: the saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated fatty acids which contain one or more carbon double bond in cis-configuration. Unsaturated fatty acids are produced by terminal desaturases that belong to the class of nonheme-iron enzymes. Each of these enzymes are part of a electron-transport system that contains two other proteins, namely cytochrome b 5 and NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. Human and other mammals have a limited spectrum of these desaturases that are required for the formation of particular double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, humans have to take up some fatty acids through their diet. Such essential fatty acids, for example, are linoleic acid (C18:2); linolenic acid (C18:3), arachidonic acid (C20:4). In contrast, insects and plants are able to synthesize a much larger variety of unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)) are essential components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). For example, over 30% of fatty acids in brain phospholipid are 22:6 (n-3) and 20:4 (n-6). (Crawford, M. A., et al., (1997) Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 66:1032S‚Äì1041S). In retina, DHA accounts for more than 60% of the total fatty acids in the rod outer segment, the photosensitive part of the photoreceptor cell. (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315‚Äì391). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129‚ÄìS138). DHA also has significant effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315‚Äì391). In addition, some positive effects of DHA were also found on diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211‚Äì215). Therefore, the appropriate dietary supply of the fatty acid is important for humans to remain healthy. It is particularly important for infant, young children and senior citizens to adequately intake these fatty acids from the diet since they cannot be efficiently synthesized in their body and must be supplemented by food (Spector, A. A. (1999) Lipids 34:S1‚ÄìS3). DHA is a fatty acid of the n-3 series according to the location of the last double bond in the methyl end. It is synthesized via alternating steps of desaturation and elongation. Starting with 18:3 (9,12,15), biosynthesis of DHA involves Œî6 desaturation to 18:4 (6,9,12,15), followed by elongation to 20:4 (8,11,14,17) and Œî5 desaturation to 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17). Beyond this point, there are some controversies about the biosynthesis. The conventional view is that 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17) is elongated to 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19) and then converted to 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19) by the final Œî4 desaturation (Horrobin, D. F. (1992) Prog. Lipid Res. 31:163‚Äì194). However, Sprecher et al. recently suggested an alternative pathway for DHA biosynthesis, which is independent of Œî4 desaturase, involving two consecutive elongations, a Œî6 desaturation and a two-carbon shortening via limited Œ≤-oxidation in peroxisome (Sprecher, H., et al. (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36:2471‚Äì2477; Sprecher, H., et al. (1999) Lipids 34:S153‚ÄìS156). Production of DHA is important because of its beneficial effect on human health. Currently the major sources of DHA are oils from fish and algae. Fish oil is a major and traditional source for this fatty acid, however, it is usually oxidized by the time it is sold. In addition, the supply of the oil is highly variable and its source is in jeopardy with the shrinking fish populations while the algal source is expensive due to low yield and the high costs of extraction. EPA and AA are both Œî5 essential fatty acids. They form a unique class of food and feed constituents for humans and animals. EPA belongs to the n-3 series with five double bonds in the acyl chain, is found in marine food, and is abundant in oily fish from North Atlantic. AA belongs to the n-6 series with four double bonds. The lack of a double bond in the œâ-3 position confers on AA different properties than those found in EPA. The eicosanoids produced from AA have strong inflammatory and platelet aggregating properties, whereas those derived from EPA have anti-inflammatory and anti-platelet aggregating properties. AA can be obtained from some foods such as meat, fish, and eggs, but the concentration is low. Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) is another essential fatty acid found in mammals. GLA is the metabolic intermediate for very long chain n-6 fatty acids and for various active molecules. In mammals, formation of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is rate-limited by Œî6 desaturation. Many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, stress, diabetes, eczema, and some infections have been shown to depress the Œî6 desaturation step. In addition, GLA is readily catabolized from the oxidation and rapid cell division associated with certain disorders, e.g., cancer or inflammation. Therefore, dietary supplementation with GLA can reduce the risks of these disorders. Clinical studies have shown that dietary supplementation with GLA is effective in treating some pathological conditions such as atopic eczema, premenstrual syndrome, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders. The predominant sources of GLA are oils from plants such as evening primrose ( Oenothera biennis ), borage ( Borago officinalis L.), black currant ( Ribes nigrum ), and from microorganisms such as Mortierella sp., Mucor sp., and Cyanobacteria . However, these GLA sources are not ideal for dietary supplementation due to large fluctuations in availability and costs associated with extraction processes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The biosynthesis of fatty acids is a major activity of plants and microorganisms. However, humans have a limited capacity for synthesizing essential fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs). Biotechnology has long been considered an efficient way to manipulate the process of producing fatty acids in plants and microorganisms. It is cost-effective and renewable with little side effects. Thus, tremendous industrial effort directed to the production of various compounds including speciality fatty acids and pharmaceutical polypeptides through the manipulation of plant, animal, and microorganismal cells has ensued. Accordingly, biotechnology is an attractive route for producing unsaturated fatty acids, especially LCPUFAs, in a safe, cost-efficient manner so as to garner the maximum therapeutic value from these fatty acids. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a family of nucleic acid molecules encoding novel desaturases. In particular, the present inventors have identified the Fad 4 (Œî4 desaturase), Fad5 and Fad5-2 (Œî5 desaturase), and Fad6 (Œî6 desaturase) which are involved in the biosynthesis of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6, n-3) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5, n-6); more specifically, Fad4 desaturate 22:5 (n-3) and 22:4 (n-6) resulting in DHA and DPA; FadS and Fad5-2 desaturate 20:4 (n-3) and 20:3(n-6) resulting in EPA and AA; and Fad6 desaturases 18:2 (n-6) and 18:3(n-3) resulting in GLA (gamma-linolenic acid) and SDA (stearidonic acid).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of novel fatty acid desaturase family members, referred to interchangeably herein as ‚Äúdesaturases‚Äù or ‚Äúdesaturase‚Äù nucleic acid and protein molecules (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6). These novel molecules are members of the fatty acid desaturase family and are expressed in LCPUFAs-producing organisms, e.g., Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare, Schizichytrium, and Crythecodinium. As used herein, the term ‚Äúfatty acids‚Äù is art recognized and includes a long-chain hydrocarbon based carboxylic acid. Fatty acids are components of many lipids including glycerides. The most common naturally occurring fatty acids are monocarboxylic acids which have an even number of carbon atoms (16 or 18) and which may be saturated or unsaturated. ‚ÄúUnsaturated‚Äù fatty acids contain cis double bonds between the carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids encompassed by the present invention include, for example, DHA, GLA, and SDA. ‚ÄúPolyunsaturated‚Äù fatty acids contain more than one double bond and the double bonds are arranged in a methylene interrupted system (‚ÄîCH‚ïêCH‚ÄîCH 2 ‚ÄîCH‚ïêCH‚Äî). Fatty acids are described herein by a numbering system in which the number before the colon indicates the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid, whereas the number after the colon is the number of double bonds that are present. In the case of unsaturated fatty acids, this is followed by a number in parentheses that indicates the position of the double bonds. Each number in parenthesis is the lower numbered carbon atom of the two connected by the double bond. For example, oleic acid can be described as 18:1(9) and linoleic acid can be described as 18:2(9, 12) indicating 18 carbons, one double bond at carbon 9, two double bonds at carbons 9 and 12, respectively. The controlling steps in the production of unsaturated fatty acids, i.e., the unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, are catalyzed by membrane-associated fatty acid desaturases, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6. Specifically, such enzymes catalyze the formation of double bonds between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule. As used herein, the term ‚Äúunsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathway‚Äù refers to a series of chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of an unsaturated fatty acid either in vivo or in vitro. Such a pathway includes a series of desaturation and elongation steps which generate unsaturated fatty acids and ultimately, long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Such unsaturated fatty acids can include, GLA 18:3 (6,9,12), SDA 18:4 (6,9,12,15), AA 20:4 (5,8,11,14), EPA 20:5 (5,8,11,14,17), and DPA 22:5 (4,7,10,13,16), and DHA 22:6 (4,7,10,13,16,19). Desaturases can contain a heme-binding motif and/or about three conservative histidine motifs, although additional domains may be present. Members of the fatty acid desaturase family convert saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs), which are components of cell membranes of various tissues and organelles in mammals (nerve, retina, brain and immune cells). Examples of LCPUFA include, among others, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6(4,7,10,13,16,19)). Clinical studies have shown that DHA is essential for the growth and development of the brain in infants, and for maintenance of normal brain function in adults (Martinetz, M. (1992) J. Pediatr. 120:S129‚ÄìS138). DHA also has effects on photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, rhodopsin activation, and rod and cone development (Giusto, N. M., et al. (2000) Prog. Lipid Res. 39:315‚Äì391). In addition, positive effects of DHA were also found in the treatment of diseases such as hypertension, arthritis, atherosclerosis, depression, thrombosis and cancers (Horrocks, L. A. and Yeo, Y. K. (1999) Pharmacol. Res. 40:211‚Äì215). Thus, the desaturase molecules can be used to produce the LCPUFAs useful in treating disorders characterized by aberrantly regulated growth, proliferation, or differentiation. Such disorders include cancer, e.g., carcinoma, sarcoma, or leukemia; tumor angiogenesis and metastasis; skeletal dysplasia; hepatic disorders; myelodysplastic syndromes; and hematopoietic and/or myeloproliferative disorders. Other disorders related to angiogenesis and which are, therefore, desaturase associated disorders include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome. The term ‚Äúfamily‚Äù when referring to the protein and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention is intended to mean two or more proteins or nucleic acid molecules having a common structural domain or motif and having sufficient amino acid or nucleotide sequence homology as defined herein. Such family members can be naturally or non-naturally occurring and can be from either the same or different species. For example, a family can contain a first protein of human origin as well as other distinct proteins of human origin or alternatively, can contain homologues of non-human origin, e.g., rat or mouse proteins. Members of a family can also have common functional characteristics. For example, the family of desaturase proteins of the present invention comprises one cytochrome b5 heme-binding motif. As used herein, the term ‚Äúheme-binding motif‚Äùis an N-terminal extension of the cytochrome b5-like domain found in front-end desaturases. In another embodiment, members of the desaturase family of proteins include a ‚Äúhistidine motifs‚Äù in the protein, preferably, about three or four histidine motifs. As used herein, the term ‚Äúhistidine motif‚Äù includes a protein domain having at least about two histidine amino acid residues, preferably about three or four histidine amino acid residues, and is typically found in all microsomal desaturases as the third conservative histidine motif. Examples of cytochrome b5 heme-binding motifs and histidine motifs include amino acid residues 41‚Äì44, 182‚Äì186, 216‚Äì223, and 453‚Äì462 of SEQ ID NO:2, amino acid residues 40‚Äì43, 171‚Äì175, 207‚Äì213, and 375‚Äì384 of SEQ ID NO:4, amino acid residues 40‚Äì45, 171‚Äì176, 208‚Äì213, and 395‚Äì400 of SEQ ID NO:6, and amino acid residues 42‚Äì47, 178‚Äì183, 215‚Äì220, and 400‚Äì405 of SEQ ID NO:8, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 6 . Isolated desaturase proteins of the present invention have an amino acid sequence sufficiently homologous to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8 or are encoded by a nucleotide sequence sufficiently homologous to SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. As used herein, the term ‚Äúsufficiently homologous‚Äù refers to a first amino acid or nucleotide sequence which contains a sufficient or minimum number of identical or equivalent (e.g., an amino acid residue which has a similar side chain) amino acid residues or nucleotides to a second amino acid or nucleotide sequence such that the first and second amino acid or nucleotide sequences share common structural domains or motifs and/or a common functional activity. For example, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share common structural domains having at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity across the amino acid sequences of the domains and contain at least one and preferably two structural domains or motifs, are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. Furthermore, amino acid or nucleotide sequences which share at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homology or identity and share a common functional activity are defined herein as sufficiently homologous. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains or motifs: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif and has an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more homologous or identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one or more of the following domains: a heme-binding motif and/or a histidine motif, and is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In another preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein includes at least one heme-binding motif and/or at least about three histidine motifs, and has a desaturase activity. As used interchangeably herein, a ‚Äúdesaturase activity,‚Äù ‚Äúbiological activity of a desaturase,‚Äù or ‚Äúfunctional activity of a desaturase,‚Äù includes an activity exerted or mediated by a desaturase protein, polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule on a desaturase responsive cell or on a desaturase substrate, as determined in vivo or in vitro, according to standard techniques. In one embodiment, a desaturase activity is a direct activity such as an association with a desaturase target molecule. As used herein, a ‚Äútarget molecule‚Äù or ‚Äúbinding partner‚Äù is a molecule e.g., a molecule involved in the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, with which a desaturase protein binds or interacts in nature such that a desaturase-mediated function is achieved. A desaturase direct activity also includes the formation of a double bond between the carbon atoms of a fatty acid molecule to form an unsaturated fatty acid molecule. The nucleotide sequence of the isolated Thraustochytrium sp. Œî4 desaturase, Fad4, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad4 cDNA are shown in FIG. 1 and in SEQ ID NOs:1 and 2, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad4 gene (the open reading frame), which is approximately 1560 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 59.1 kD and which is approximately 519 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Thraustochytrium sp. Œî5 desaturase, Fad5, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5 cDNA are shown in FIG. 2 and in SEQ ID NOs:3 and 4, respectively. The Thraustochytrium sp. Fad5 gene, which is approximately 1320 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having a molecular weight of approximately 49.8 kD and which is approximately 439 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî 5 desaturase, Fad5-2, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad5-2 cDNA are shown in FIG. 4 and in SEQ ID NOs:5 and 6, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad5-2 gene, which is approximately 1371 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 456 amino acid residues in length. The nucleotide sequence of the Pythium irregulare Œî 6 desaturase, Fad6, cDNA and the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the Fad6 cDNA are shown in FIG. 5 and in SEQ ID NOs:7 and 8, respectively. The Pythium irregulare Fad6 gene, which is approximately 1383 nucleotides in length, encodes a protein having approximately 460 amino acid residues in length. Various aspects of the invention are described in further detail in the following subsections: I. Isolated Nucleic Acid Molecules One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated nucleic acid molecules that encode desaturase proteins or biologically active portions thereof, as well as nucleic acid fragments sufficient for use as hybridization probes to identify desaturase-encoding nucleic acid molecules (e.g., desaturase mRNA) and fragments for use as PCR primers for the amplification or mutation of desaturase nucleic acid molecules. As used herein, the term ‚Äúnucleic acid molecule‚Äù is intended to include DNA molecules (e.g., cDNA or genomic DNA) and RNA molecules (e.g., mRNA) and analogs of the DNA or RNA generated using nucleotide analogs. The nucleic acid molecule can be single-stranded or double-stranded, but preferably is double-stranded DNA. The term ‚Äúisolated nucleic acid molecule‚Äù includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from other nucleic acid molecules which are present in the natural source of the nucleic acid. For example, with regards to genomic DNA, the term ‚Äúisolated‚Äù includes nucleic acid molecules which are separated from the chromosome with which the genomic DNA is naturally associated. Preferably, an ‚Äúisolated‚Äù nucleic acid is free of sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid (i.e., sequences located at the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ ends of the nucleic acid) in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid is derived. For example, in various embodiments, the isolated desaturase nucleic acid molecule can contain less than about 5 kb, 4 kb, 3 kb, 2 kb, 1 kb, 0.5 kb or 0.1 kb of nucleotide sequences which naturally flank the nucleic acid molecule in genomic DNA of the cell from which the nucleic acid is derived. Moreover, an ‚Äúisolated‚Äù nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA molecule, can be substantially free of other cellular material, or culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. A nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, e.g., a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, 7, or a portion thereof, can be isolated using standard molecular biology techniques and the sequence information provided herein. Using all or a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, as hybridization probes, desaturase nucleic acid molecules can be isolated using standard hybridization and cloning techniques (e.g., as described in Sambrook, J. et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2 nd , ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989). Moreover, a nucleic acid molecule encompassing all or a portion of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, can be isolated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers designed based upon the sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3,5, or 7. A nucleic acid of the invention can be amplified using cDNA, mRNA or alternatively, genomic DNA, as a template and appropriate oligonucleotide primers according to standard PCR amplification techniques. The nucleic acid so amplified can be cloned into an appropriate vector and characterized by DNA sequence analysis. Furthermore, oligonucleotides corresponding to desaturase nucleotide sequences can be prepared by standard synthetic techniques, e.g., using an automated DNA synthesizer. In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule consists of the nucleotide sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention comprises a nucleic acid molecule which is a complement of the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, or a portion of any of these nucleotide sequences. A nucleic acid molecule which is complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 is one which is sufficiently complementary to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that it can hybridize to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby forming a stable duplex. In still another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 (e.g., to the entire length of the nucleotide sequence), or a portion or complement of any of these nucleotide sequences. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention comprises a nucleotide sequence which is at least (or no greater than) 50‚Äì100, 100‚Äì250, 250‚Äì500, 500‚Äì750, 750‚Äì1000, 1000‚Äì1250, 1250‚Äì1500, 1500‚Äì1750, 1750‚Äì2000, 2000‚Äì2250, 2250‚Äì2500, 2500‚Äì2750, 2750‚Äì3000, 3250‚Äì3500, 3500‚Äì3750 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. Moreover, the nucleic acid molecule of the invention can comprise only a portion of the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, a fragment which can be used as a probe or primer or a fragment encoding a portion of a desaturase protein, e.g. a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein. The nucleotide sequence determined from the cloning of the desaturase gene allows for the generation of probes and primers designed for use in identifying and/or cloning other desaturase family members, as well as desaturase homologues from other species. The probe/primer (e.g., oligonucleotide) typically comprises substantially purified oligonucleotide. The oligonucleotide typically comprises a region of nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under stringent conditions to at least about 12 or 15, preferably about 20 or 25, more preferably about 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, or 75 consecutive nucleotides of a sense sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, ofan anti-sense sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or of a naturally occurring allelic variant or mutant of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. Exemplary probes or primers are at least (or no greater than) 12 or 15, 20 or 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 or more nucleotides in length and/or comprise consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein. Also included within the scope of the present invention are probes or primers comprising contiguous or consecutive nucleotides of an isolated nucleic acid molecule described herein, but for the difference of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases within the probe or primer sequence. Probes based on the desaturase nucleotide sequences can be used to detect (e.g., specifically detect) transcripts or genomic sequences encoding the same or homologous proteins. In preferred embodiments, the probe further comprises a label group attached thereto, e.g., the label group can be a radioisotope, a fluorescent compound, an enzyme, or an enzyme co-factor. In another embodiment a set of primers is provided, e.g., primers suitable for use in a PCR, which can be used to amplify a selected region of a desaturase sequence, e.g., a domain, region, site or other sequence described herein. The primers should be at least 5, 10, or 50 base pairs in length and less than 100, or less than 200, base pairs in length. The primers should be identical, or differ by no greater than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bases when compared to a sequence disclosed herein or to the sequence of a naturally occurring variant. Such probes can be used as a part of a diagnostic test kit for identifying cells or tissue which misexpress a desaturase protein, such as by measuring a level of a desaturase-encoding nucleic acid in a sample of cells from a subject, e.g., detecting desaturase mRNA levels or determining whether a genomic desaturase gene has been mutated or deleted. A nucleic acid fragment encoding a ‚Äúbiologically active portion of a desaturase protein‚Äù can be prepared by isolating a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, which encodes a polypeptide having a desaturase biological activity (the biological activities of the desaturase proteins are described herein), expressing the encoded portion of the desaturase protein (e.g., by recombinant expression in vitro) and assessing the activity of the encoded portion of the desaturase protein. In an exemplary embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is at least 50‚Äì100, 100‚Äì250, 250‚Äì500, 500‚Äì700, 750‚Äì1000, 1000‚Äì1250, 1250‚Äì1500, 1500‚Äì1750, 1750‚Äì2000, 2000‚Äì2250, 2250‚Äì2500, 2500‚Äì2750, 2750‚Äì3000, 3250‚Äì3500, 3500‚Äì3750 or more nucleotides in length and encodes a protein having a desaturase activity (as described herein). The invention further encompasses nucleic acid molecules that differ from the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 due to degeneracy of the genetic code and thus encode the same desaturase proteins as those encoded by the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. In another embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention has a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein having an amino acid sequence which differs by at least 1, but no greater than 5, 10, 20, 50 or 100 amino acid residues from the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. In yet another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule encodes the amino acid sequence of human desaturase. If an alignment is needed for this comparison, the sequences should be aligned for maximum homology. Nucleic acid variants can be naturally occurring, such as allelic variants (same locus), homologues (different locus), and orthologues (different organism) or can be non naturally occurring. Non-naturally occurring variants can be made by mutagenesis techniques, including those applied to polynucleotides, cells, or organisms. The variants can contain nucleotide substitutions, deletions, inversions and insertions. Variation can occur in either or both the coding and non-coding regions. The variations can produce both conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions (as compared in the encoded product). Allelic variants result, for example, from DNA sequence polymorphisms within a population (e.g., the human population) that lead to changes in the amino acid sequences of the desaturase proteins. Such genetic polymorphism in the desaturase genes may exist among individuals within a population due to natural allelic variation. As used herein, the terms ‚Äúgene‚Äù and ‚Äúrecombinant gene‚Äù refer to nucleic acid molecules which include an open reading frame encoding a desaturase protein, e.g., oilseed desaturase protein, and can further include non-coding regulatory sequences, and introns. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention features isolated nucleic acid molecules which encode a naturally occurring allelic variant of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, wherein the nucleic acid molecule hybridizes to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions. Allelic variants of desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, include both functional and non-functional desaturase proteins. Functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein that maintain the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., a fatty acid, e.g., 22:5(n-3)); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. The fatty acids produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention are also useful in treating disorders such as aging, stress, diabetes, cancer, inflammatory disorders (e.g., arthritis, eczema), and cardiovascular disorders. Functional allelic variants will typically contain only a conservative substitution of one or more amino acids of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, deletion or insertion of non-critical residues in non-critical regions of the protein. Non-functional allelic variants are naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants of the desaturase protein, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6, that do not have the ability to, e.g., (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid, such as 18:4 (6,9,12,15); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. Non-functional allelic variants will typically contain a non-conservative substitution, a deletion, or insertion, or premature truncation of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, or a substitution, insertion, or deletion in critical residues or critical regions of the protein. The present invention further provides orthologues (e.g., human orthologues of the desaturase proteins). Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins are proteins that are isolated from other organisms and possess the same desaturase substrate or target molecule binding mechanisms, double bond forming mechanisms, modulating mechanisms of growth and development of the brain in infants, maintenance mechanisms of normal brain function in adults, ability to affect photoreceptor function involved in the signal transduction process, ability to affect rhodopsin activation, development mechanisms of rods and/or cones, and/or modulating mechanisms of cellular growth and/or proliferation of the non-human desaturase proteins. Orthologues of the Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare desaturase proteins can readily be identified as comprising an amino acid sequence that is substantially homologous to SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding other desaturase family embers and, thus, which have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, another desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Moreover, nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins from different species, and which, thus, have a nucleotide sequence which differs from the desaturase sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 are intended to be within the scope of the invention. For example, Schizochytrium or Crythecodinium desaturase cDNA can be identified based on the nucleotide sequence of a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6. Nucleic acid molecules corresponding to natural allelic variants and homologues of the desaturase cDNAs of the invention can be isolated based on their homology to the desaturase nucleic acids disclosed herein using the cDNAs disclosed herein, or a portion thereof, as a hybridization probe according to standard hybridization techniques under stringent hybridization conditions. Orthologues, homologues and allelic variants can be identified using methods known in the art (e.g., by hybridization to an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, for example, under stringent hybridization conditions). In one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention is at least 15, 20, 25, 30 or more nucleotides in length and hybridizes under stringent conditions to the nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7. In other embodiment, the nucleic acid is at least 50‚Äì100, 100‚Äì250, 250‚Äì500, 500‚Äì700, 750‚Äì1000, 1000‚Äì1250, 1250‚Äì1500, 1500‚Äì1750, 1750‚Äì2000, 2000‚Äì2250, 2250‚Äì2500, 2500‚Äì2750, 2750‚Äì3000, 3250‚Äì3500, 3500‚Äì3750 or more nucleotides in length. As used herein, the term ‚Äúhybridizes under stringent conditions‚Äù is intended to describe conditions for hybridization and washing under which nucleotide sequences that are significantly identical or homologous to each other remain hybridized to each other. Preferably, the conditions are such that sequences at least about 70%, more preferably at least about 80%, even more preferably at least about 85% or 90% identical to each other remain hybridized to each other. Such stringent conditions are known to those skilled in the art and can be found in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , Ausubel et al., eds., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1995), sections 2, 4, and 6. Additional stringent conditions can be found in Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual , Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989), chapters 7, 9, and 11. A preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4√ó sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65‚Äì70¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 4√óSSC plus 50% formamide at about 42‚Äì50¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 1√ó SSC, at about 65‚Äì70¬∞ C. A preferred, non-limiting example of highly stringent hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 1√óSSC, at about 65‚Äì70¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 1√óSSC plus 50% formamide at about 42‚Äì50¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 0.3√óSSC, at about 65‚Äì70¬∞ C. A preferred, non-limiting example of reduced stringency hybridization conditions includes hybridization in 4√óSSC, at about 50‚Äì60¬∞ C. (or alternatively hybridization in 6√óSSC plus 50% formamide at about 40‚Äì45¬∞ C.) followed by one or more washes in 2√óSSC, at about 50‚Äì60¬∞ C. Ranges intermediate to the above-recited values, e.g., at 65‚Äì70¬∞ C. or at 42‚Äì50¬∞ C. are also intended to be encompassed by the present invention. SSPE (1√óSSPE is 0.15M NaCl, 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , and 1.25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1√óSSC is 0.15M NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and wash buffers; washes are performed for 15 minutes each after hybridization is complete. The hybridization temperature for hybrids anticipated to be less than 50 base pairs in length should be 5‚Äì10¬∞ C. less than the melting temperature (T m ) of the hybrid, where Tm is determined according to the following equations. For hybrids less than 18 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞ C.)=2(# of A+T bases)+4(# of G+C bases). For hybrids between 18 and 49 base pairs in length, T m (¬∞ C.)=81.5+16.6(log 10 [Na + ])+0.41(% G+C)‚àí(600/N), where N is the number of bases in the hybrid, and [Na + ] is the concentration of sodium ions in the hybridization buffer ([Na + ] for 1√óSSC=0.165 M). It will also be recognized by the skilled practitioner that additional reagents may be added to hybridization and/or wash buffers to decrease non-specific hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to membranes, for example, nitrocellulose or nylon membranes, including but not limited to blocking agents (e.g., BSA or salmon or herring sperm carrier DNA), detergents (e.g., SDS), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA), Ficoll, PVP and the like. When using nylon membranes, in particular, an additional preferred, non-limiting example of stringent hybridization conditions is hybridization in 0.25‚Äì0.5M NaH 2 PO 4 , 7% SDS at about 65¬∞ C., followed by one or more washes at 0.02M NaH 2 PO 4 , 1% SDS at 65¬∞ C. (see e.g., Church and Gilbert (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:1991‚Äì1995), or alternatively 0.2√óSSC, 1% SDS. Preferably, an isolated nucleic acid molecule of the invention that hybridizes under stringent conditions to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7 corresponds to a naturally-occurring nucleic acid molecule. As used herein, a ‚Äúnaturally-occurring‚Äù nucleic acid molecule refers to an RNA or DNA molecule having a nucleotide sequence that occurs in nature (e.g., encodes a natural protein). In addition to naturally-occurring allelic variants of the desaturase sequences that may exist in the population, the skilled artisan will further appreciate that changes can be introduced by mutation into the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7, thereby leading to changes in the amino acid sequence of the encoded desaturase proteins, without altering the functional ability of the desaturase proteins. For example, nucleotide substitutions leading to amino acid substitutions at ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù amino acid residues can be made in the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, or 7. A ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered from the wild-type sequence of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 (e.g., the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, 5, 8, or 11) without altering the biological activity, whereas an ‚Äúessential‚Äù amino acid residue is required for biological activity. For example, amino acid residues that are conserved among the desaturase proteins of the present invention, e.g., those present in a heme-binding motif or a histidine motif, are predicted to be particularly unamenable to alteration. Furthermore, additional amino acid residues that are conserved between the desaturase proteins of the present invention and other members of the fatty acid desaturase family are not likely to be amenable to alteration. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules encoding desaturase proteins that contain changes in amino acid residues that are not essential for activity. Such desaturase proteins differ in amino acid sequence from SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8, yet retain biological activity. In one embodiment, the isolated nucleic acid molecule comprises a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein, wherein the protein comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% 99% or more homologous to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, e.g., to the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, or 8. An isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a desaturase protein homologous to the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations can be introduced into SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7 by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. Preferably, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more predicted non-essential amino acid residues. A ‚Äúconservative amino acid substitution‚Äù is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, a predicted nonessential amino acid residue in a desaturase protein is preferably replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. Alternatively, in another embodiment, mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of a desaturase coding sequence, such as by saturation mutagenesis, and the resultant mutants can be screened for desaturase biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity. Following mutagenesis of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, the encoded protein can be expressed recombinantly and the activity of the protein can be determined. In a preferred embodiment, a mutant desaturase protein can be assayed for the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. II. Isolated Desaturase Proteins One aspect of the invention pertains to isolated or recombinant desaturase proteins and polypeptides, and biologically active portions thereof. In one embodiment, native desaturase proteins can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. In another embodiment, desaturase proteins are produced by recombinant DNA techniques. Alternative to recombinant expression, a desaturase protein or polypeptide can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide synthesis techniques. An ‚Äúisolated‚Äù or ‚Äúpurified‚Äù protein or biologically active portion thereof is substantially free of cellular material or other contaminating proteins from the cell or tissue source from which the desaturase protein is derived, or substantially free from chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized. The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of cellular material‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from cellular components of the cells from which it is isolated or recombinantly produced. In one embodiment, the language ‚Äúsubstantially free of cellular material‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, or 30% (by dry weight) of non-desaturase protein (also referred to herein as a ‚Äúcontaminating protein‚Äù), more preferably less than about 20% of non-desaturase protein, still more preferably less than about 10% of non-desaturase protein, and most preferably less than about 5% non-desaturase protein. When the desaturase protein or biologically active portion thereof is recombinantly produced, it is also preferably substantially free of culture medium, i.e., culture medium represents less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, and most preferably less than about 5% of the volume of the protein preparation. The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein in which the protein is separated from chemical precursors or other chemicals which are involved in the synthesis of the protein. In one embodiment, the language ‚Äúsubstantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals‚Äù includes preparations of desaturase protein having less than about 30% (by dry weight) of chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, more preferably less than about 20% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, still more preferably less than about 10% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals, and most preferably less than about 5% chemical precursors or non-desaturase chemicals. It should be understood that the proteins or this invention can also be in a form which is different than their corresponding naturally occurring proteins and/or which is still in association with at least some cellular components. For example, the protein can be associated with a cellular membrane. As used herein, a ‚Äúbiologically active portion‚Äù of a desaturase protein includes a fragment of a desaturase protein which participates in an interaction between a desaturase molecule and a non-desaturase molecule (e.g., a desaturase substrate such as fatty acid). Biologically active portions of a desaturase protein include peptides comprising amino acid sequences sufficiently homologous to or derived from the desaturase amino acid sequences, e.g., the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 which include sufficient amino acid residues to exhibit at least one activity of a desaturase protein. Typically, biologically active portions comprise a domain or motif with at least one activity of the desaturase protein; the ability to (i) interact with a desaturase substrate or target molecule (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid); and/or (ii) form a double bond between carbon atoms in a desaturase substrate or target molecule. A biologically active portion of a desaturase protein can be a polypeptide which is, for example, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050, 1100, 1150, 1200 or more amino acids in length. In one embodiment, a biologically active portion of a desaturase protein comprises a heme-binding motif and/or at least one histidine motifs, preferably about three histidine motifs. Moreover, other biologically active portions, in which other regions of the protein are deleted, can be prepared by recombinant techniques and evaluated for one or more of the functional activities of a native desaturase protein. In a preferred embodiment, a desaturase protein has an amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In other embodiments, the desaturase protein is substantially identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8 and retains the functional activity of the protein of SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8, yet differs in amino acid sequence due to natural allelic variation or mutagenesis, as described in detail in subsection I above. In another embodiment, the desaturase protein is a protein which comprises an amino acid sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more identical to SEQ ID NO: 2, 4, 6, or 8. In another embodiment, the invention features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more 99% or more identical to a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. This invention further features a desaturase protein which is encoded by a nucleic acid molecule consisting of a nucleotide sequence which hybridizes under stringent hybridization conditions to a complement of a nucleic acid molecule comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7, or a complement thereof. To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In a preferred embodiment, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, even more preferably at least 60%, and even more preferably at least 70%, 80%, or 90% of the length of the reference sequence (e.g., when aligning a second sequence to the Fad4 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 having 519 amino acid residues, at least 156, preferably at least 208, more preferably at least 260, even more preferably at least 311, and even more preferably at least 363, 415, or 467 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 having 439 amino acid residues, at least 132, preferably at least 176, more preferably at least 220, even more preferably at least 263, and even more preferably at least 307, 351, or 395 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad5-2 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 having 456 amino acid residues, at least 137, preferably at least 182, more preferably at least 228, even more preferably at least 273, and even more preferably at least 319, 365, or 419 amino acid residues are aligned; when aligning a second sequence to the Fad6 amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:8 having 460 amino acid residues, at least 138, preferably at least 184, more preferably at least 230, even more preferably at least 276, and even more preferably at least 322, 368, or 414 amino acid residues are aligned). The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position (as used herein amino acid or nucleic acid ‚Äúidentity‚Äù is equivalent to amino acid or nucleic acid ‚Äúhomology‚Äù). The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. In a preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences is determined using the Needleman and Wunsch ( J. Mol. Biol . (48):444‚Äì453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package, using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. In yet another preferred embodiment, the percent identity between two nucleotide sequences is determined using the GAP program in the GCG software package, using a NWSgapdna.CMP matrix and a gap weight of 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 and a length weight of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. A preferred, non-limiting example of parameters to be used in conjunction with the GAP program include a Blosum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. In another embodiment, the percent identity between two amino acid or nucleotide sequences is determined using the algorithm of Meyers and Miller ( Comput. Appl. Biosci., 4:11‚Äì17 (1988)) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0 or version 2.0U), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. The nucleic acid and protein sequences of the present invention can further be used as a ‚Äúquery sequence‚Äù to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify other family members or related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the NBLAST and XBLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403‚Äì10. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program, score=100, wordlength=12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to desaturase nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score=50, wordlength=3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to desaturase protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25(17):3389‚Äì3402. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. III. Methods of Producing Unsaturated Fatty Acids The present invention provides new and improved methods of producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., LCPUFAs, such as, DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 (n-6)), DPA (docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 (n-6)), AA (Arachidonic acid, 20:4 (n-6)) and EPA (eicosapentaenioc acid, 20:5(n-3)). A. Recombinant Cells and Methods for Culturing Cells The present invention further features recombinant vectors that include nucleic acid sequences that encode the gene products as described herein, preferably Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 gene products. The term recombinant vector includes a vector (e.g., plasmid) that has been altered, modified or engineered such that it contains greater, fewer or different nucleic acid sequences than those included in the native vector or plasmid. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector includes the nucleic acid sequence encoding at least one fatty acid desaturase enzyme operably linked to regulatory sequences. The phrase ‚Äúoperably linked to regulatory sequence(s)‚Äù means that the nucleotide sequence of interest is linked to the regulatory sequence(s) in a manner which allows for expression (e.g., enhanced, increased, constitutive, basal, attenuated, decreased or repressed expression) of the nucleotide sequence, preferably expression of a gene product encoded by the nucleotide sequence (e.g., when the recombinant vector is introduced into a cell). Exemplary vectors are described in further detail herein as well as in, for example, Frascotti et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,137, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. The term ‚Äúregulatory sequence‚Äù includes nucleic acid sequences which affect (e.g., modulate or regulate) expression of other (non-regulatory) nucleic acid sequences. In one embodiment, a regulatory sequence is included in a recombinant vector in a similar or identical position and/or orientation relative to a particular gene of interest as is observed for the regulatory sequence and gene of interest as it appears in nature, e.g., in a native position and/or orientation. For example, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to the gene in the natural organism (e.g., operably linked to ‚Äúnative‚Äù Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequence (e.g., to the ‚Äúnative‚Äù Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 promoter). Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a recombinant vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence which accompanies or is adjacent to another (e.g., a different) gene in the natural organism. For example, a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene can be included in a vector operably linked to non-Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 regulatory sequences. Alternatively, a gene of interest (e.g., a Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 gene) can be included in a vector operably linked to a regulatory sequence from another organism. For example, regulatory sequences from other microbes (e.g., other bacterial regulatory sequences, bacteriophage regulatory sequences and the like) can be operably linked to a particular gene of interest. Preferred regulatory sequences include promoters, enhancers, termination signals and other expression control elements (e.g., binding sites for transcriptional and/or translational regulatory proteins, for example, in the transcribed mRNA). Such regulatory sequences are described, for example, in Sambrook, J., Fritsh, E. F., and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd, ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989. Regulatory sequences include those which direct constitutive expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., constitutive promoters and strong constitutive promoters), those which direct inducible expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., inducible promoters, for example, xylose inducible promoters) and those which attenuate or repress expression of a nucleotide sequence in a cell (e.g., attenuation signals or repressor sequences). It is also within the scope of the present invention to regulate expression of a gene of interest by removing or deleting regulatory sequences. For example, sequences involved in the negative regulation of transcription can be removed such that expression of a gene of interest is enhanced. In one embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes nucleic acid sequences that encode at least one gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) operably linked to a promoter or promoter sequence. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes a terminator sequence or terminator sequences (e.g., transcription terminator sequences). The term ‚Äúterminator sequences‚Äù includes regulatory sequences which serve to terminate transcription of mRNA. Terminator sequences (or tandem transcription terminators) can further serve to stabilize mRNA (e.g., by adding structure to MRNA), for example, against nucleases. In yet another embodiment, a recombinant vector of the present invention includes antibiotic resistance sequences. The term ‚Äúantibiotic resistance sequences‚Äù includes sequences which promote or confer resistance to antibiotics on the host organism. In one embodiment, the antibiotic resistance sequences are selected from the group consisting of cat (chloramphenicol resistance), tet (tetracycline resistance) sequences, erm (erythromycin resistance) sequences, neo (neomycin resistance) sequences and spec (spectinomycin resistance) sequences. Recombinant vectors of the present invention can further include homologous recombination sequences (e.g., sequences designed to allow recombination of the gene of interest into the chromosome of the host organism). For example, amyE sequences can be used as homology targets for recombination into the host chromosome. The term ‚Äúmanipulated cell‚Äù includes a cell that has been engineered (e.g., genetically engineered) or modified such that the cell has at least one fatty acid desaturase, e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and/or Fad6, such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced. Modification or engineering of such microorganisms can be according to any methodology described herein including, but not limited to, deregulation of a biosynthetic pathway and/or overexpression of at least one biosynthetic enzyme. A ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù enzyme (e.g., a ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù biosynthetic enzyme) includes an enzyme, the expression or production of which has been altered or modified such that at least one upstream or downstream precursor, substrate or product of the enzyme is altered or modified, for example, as compared to a corresponding wild-type or naturally occurring enzyme. The term ‚Äúoverexpressed‚Äù or ‚Äúoverexpression‚Äù includes expression of a gene product (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase) at a level greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. In one embodiment, the cell can be genetically manipulated (e.g., genetically engineered) to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. Genetic manipulation can include, but is not limited to, altering or modifying regulatory sequences or sites associated with expression of a particular gene (e.g., by adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or by removing regulatory sequences such that expression is constitutive), modifying the chromosomal location of a particular gene, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to a particular gene such as a ribosome binding site or transcription terminator, increasing the copy number of a particular gene, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of a particular gene routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). In another embodiment, the cell can be physically or environmentally manipulated to overexpress a level of gene product greater than that expressed prior to manipulation of the cell or in a comparable cell which has not been manipulated. For example, a cell can be treated with or cultured in the presence of an agent known or suspected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. Alternatively, a cell can be cultured at a temperature selected to increase transcription of a particular gene and/or translation of a particular gene product such that transcription and/or translation are enhanced or increased. The term ‚Äúderegulated‚Äù or ‚Äúderegulation‚Äù includes the alteration or modification of at least one gene in a cell that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway, such that the level or activity of the biosynthetic enzyme in the cell is altered or modified. Preferably, at least one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the gene product is enhanced or increased. The phrase ‚Äúderegulated pathway‚Äù can also include a biosynthetic pathway in which more than one gene that encodes an enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway is altered or modified such that the level or activity of more than one biosynthetic enzyme is altered or modified. The ability to ‚Äúderegulate‚Äù a pathway (e.g., to simultaneously deregulate more than one gene in a given biosynthetic pathway) in a cell arises from the particular phenomenon of cells in which more than one enzyme (e.g., two or three biosynthetic enzymes) are encoded by genes occurring adjacent to one another on a contiguous piece of genetic material termed an ‚Äúoperon‚Äù. The term ‚Äúoperon‚Äù includes a coordinated unit of gene expression that contains a promoter and possibly a regulatory element associated with one or more, preferably at least two, structural genes (e.g., genes encoding enzymes, for example, biosynthetic enzymes). Expression of the structural genes can be coordinately regulated, for example, by regulatory proteins binding to the regulatory element or by anti-termination of transcription. The structural genes can be transcribed to give a single mRNA that encodes all of the structural proteins. Due to the coordinated regulation of genes included in an operon, alteration or modification of the single promoter and/or regulatory element can result in alteration or modification of each gene product encoded by the operon. Alteration or modification of the regulatory element can include, but is not limited to removing the endogenous promoter and/or regulatory element(s), adding strong promoters, inducible promoters or multiple promoters or removing regulatory sequences such that expression of the gene products is modified, modifying the chromosomal location of the operon, altering nucleic acid sequences adjacent to the operon or within the operon such as a ribosome binding site, increasing the copy number of the operon, modifying proteins (e.g., regulatory proteins, suppressors, enhancers, transcriptional activators and the like) involved in transcription of the operon and/or translation of the gene products of the operon, or any other conventional means of deregulating expression of genes routine in the art (including but not limited to use of antisense nucleic acid molecules, for example, to block expression of repressor proteins). Deregulation can also involve altering the coding region of one or more genes to yield, for example, an enzyme that is feedback resistant or has a higher or lower specific activity. A particularly preferred ‚Äúrecombinant‚Äù cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a plant-derived gene or gene product or an microorganismally-derived gene or gene product. The term ‚Äúplant-derived,‚Äù ‚Äúmicroorganismally-derived,‚Äù or ‚Äúderived-from,‚Äù for example, includes a gene which is naturally found in a microorganism or a plant, e.g., an oilseed plant, or a gene product (e.g., Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6) or which is encoded by a plant gene or a gene from a microorganism (e.g., encoded SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ IDNO:5, or SEQ ID NO:7). The methodologies of the present invention feature recombinant cells which overexpress at least one fatty acid desaturase. In one embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Thrauschytrium sp. fatty acid desaturase (e.g., has been engineered to overexpress at least one of Thrauschytrium sp. Œî4 or Œî5 desaturase (the Fad4 or Fad5 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or 4 or encoded by the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 or 3). In another embodiment, a recombinant cell of the present invention has been genetically engineered to overexpress a Pythium irregulare Œî5 or Œî6 desaturase (the Fad5-2 or Fad6 gene product) (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 or 8 or encoded by a nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 or 7). In another embodiment, the invention features a cell (e.g., a microbial cell) that has been transformed with a vector comprising a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence (e.g., a fatty acid desaturase nucleic acid sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO:1, 3, 5, or 7). Another aspect of the present invention features a method of modulating the production of fatty acids comprising culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g., a desaturase) such that modulation of fatty acid production occurs (e.g., production of unsaturated fatty acids is enhanced). The method of culturing cells transformed by the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention (e.g. Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6) to modulate the production of fatty acids is referred to herein as ‚Äúbiotransformation.‚Äù The biotransformation processes can utilize recombinant cells and/or desaturases described herein. The term ‚Äúbiotransformation process,‚Äù also referred to herein as ‚Äúbioconversion processes,‚Äù includes biological processes which result in the production (e.g., transformation or conversion) of any compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is upstream of a fatty acid desaturase to a compound (e.g., substrate, intermediate, or product) which is downstream of a fatty acid desaturase, in particular, an unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of an unsaturated fatty acid comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses at least one fatty acid desaturase with at least one appropriate substrate under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced and, optionally, recovering the fatty acid. In a preferred embodiment, the invention features a biotransformation process for the production of unsaturated fatty acids comprising contacting a cell which overexpresses Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, or Fad6 with an appropriate substrate (e.g., an intermediate fatty acid) under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA, SDA, or GLA) is produced and, optionally, recovering the unsaturated fatty acid. Conditions under which an unsaturated fatty acid is produced can include any conditions which result in the desired production of an unsaturated fatty acid. The cell(s) and/or enzymes used in the biotransformation reactions are in a form allowing them to perform their intended function (e.g., producing a desired fatty acids). The cells can be whole cells, or can be only those portions of the cells necessary to obtain the desired end result. The cells can be suspended (e.g., in an appropriate solution such as buffered solutions or media), rinsed (e.g., rinsed free of media from culturing the cell), acetone-dried, immobilized (e.g., with polyacrylamide gel or k-carrageenan or on synthetic supports, for example, beads, matrices and the like), fixed, cross-linked or permeablized (e.g., have permeablized membranes and/or walls such that compounds, for example, substrates, intermediates or products can more easily pass through said membrane or wall). The type of cell can be any cell capable of being used within the methods of the invention, e.g., plant, animal, or microbial cells. An important aspect of the present invention involves growing the recombinant plant or culturing the recombinant microorganisms described herein, such that a desired compound (e.g., a desired unsaturated fatty acid) is produced. The term ‚Äúculturing‚Äù includes maintaining and/or growing a living microorganism of the present invention (e.g., maintaining and/or growing a culture or strain). In one embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in liquid media. In another embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in solid media or semi-solid media. In a preferred embodiment, a microorganism of the invention is cultured in media (e.g., a sterile, liquid media) comprising nutrients essential or beneficial to the maintenance and/or growth of the microorganism (e.g., carbon sources or carbon substrate, for example complex carbohydrates such as bean or grain meal, starches, sugars, sugar alcohols, hydrocarbons, oils, fats, fatty acids, organic acids and alcohols; nitrogen sources, for example, vegetable proteins, peptones, peptides and amino acids derived from grains, beans and tubers, proteins, peptides and amino acids derived form animal sources such as meat, milk and animal byproducts such as peptones, meat extracts and casein hydrolysates; inorganic nitrogen sources such as urea, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and ammonium phosphate; phosphorus sources, for example, phosphoric acid, sodium and potassium salts thereof; trace elements, for example, magnesium, iron, manganese, calcium, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum, and/or cobalt salts; as well as growth factors such as amino acids, vitamins, growth promoters and the like). Preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled pH. The term ‚Äúcontrolled pH‚Äù includes any pH which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of about 7. In another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured at a pH of between 6.0 and 8.5. The desired pH may be maintained by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art. Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured under controlled aeration. The term ‚Äúcontrolled aeration‚Äù includes sufficient aeration (e.g., oxygen) to result in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, aeration is controlled by regulating oxygen levels in the culture, for example, by regulating the amount of oxygen dissolved in culture media. Preferably, aeration of the culture is controlled by agitating the culture. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the growth vessel (e.g., fermentor) or by various pumping equipment. Aeration may be further controlled by the passage of sterile air or oxygen through the medium (e.g., through the fermentation mixture). Also preferably, microorganisms of the present invention are cultured without excess foaming (e.g., via addition of antifoaming agents). Moreover, plants or microorganisms of the present invention can be cultured under controlled temperatures. The term ‚Äúcontrolled temperature‚Äù includes any temperature which results in production of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). In one embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞ C. and 95¬∞ C. In another embodiment, controlled temperatures include temperatures between 15¬∞ C. and 70¬∞ C. Preferred temperatures are between 20¬∞ C. and 55¬∞ C., more preferably between 30¬∞ C. and 45¬∞ C. or between 30¬∞ C. and 50¬∞ C. Microorganisms can be cultured (e.g., maintained and/or grown) in liquid media and preferably are cultured, either continuously or intermittently, by conventional culturing methods such as standing culture, test tube culture, shaking culture (e.g., rotary shaking culture, shake flask culture, etc.), aeration spinner culture, or fermentation. In a preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in shake flasks. In a more preferred embodiment, the microorganisms are cultured in a fermentor (e.g., a fermentation process). Fermentation processes of the present invention include, but are not limited to, batch, fed-batch and continuous methods of fermentation. The phrase ‚Äúbatch process‚Äù or ‚Äúbatch fermentation‚Äù refers to a closed system in which the composition of media, nutrients, supplemental additives and the like is set at the beginning of the fermentation and not subject to alteration during the fermentation, however, attempts may be made to control such factors as pH and oxygen concentration to prevent excess media acidification and/or microorganism death. The phrase ‚Äúfed-batch process‚Äù or ‚Äúfed-batch‚Äù fermentation refers to a batch fermentation with the exception that one or more substrates or supplements are added (e.g., added in increments or continuously) as the fermentation progresses. The phrase ‚Äúcontinuous process‚Äù or ‚Äúcontinuous fermentation‚Äù refers to a system in which a defined fermentation media is added continuously to a fermentor and an equal amount of used or ‚Äúconditioned‚Äù media is simultaneously removed, preferably for recovery of the desired product (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). A variety of such processes have been developed and are well-known in the art. The phrase ‚Äúculturing under conditions such that a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid, for example, DHA) is produced‚Äù includes maintaining and/or growing plants or microorganisms under conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure, pH, duration, etc.) appropriate or sufficient to obtain production of the desired compound or to obtain desired yields of the particular compound being produced. For example, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to produce the desired amount of a unsaturated fatty acid (e.g., DHA). Preferably, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to substantially reach maximal production of the unsaturated fatty acid. In one embodiment, culturing is continued for about 12 to 24 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for about 24 to 36 hours, 36 to 48 hours, 48 to 72 hours, 72 to 96 hours, 96 to 120 hours, 120 to 144 hours, or greater than 144 hours. In another embodiment, culturing is continued for a time sufficient to reach production yields of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, cells are cultured such that at least about 15 to 20 g/L of unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 20 to 25 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 25 to 30 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 30 to 35 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced, at least about 35 to 40 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced (e.g., at least about 37 g/L unsaturated fatty acids) or at least about 40 to 50 g/L unsaturated fatty acids are produced. In yet another embodiment, microorganisms are cultured under conditions such that a preferred yield of unsaturated fatty acids, for example, a yield within a range set forth above, is produced in about 24 hours, in about 36 hours, in about 48 hours, in about 72 hours, or in about 96 hours. In producing unsaturated fatty acids, it may further be desirable to culture cells of the present invention in the presence of supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates. The term ‚Äúsupplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrate‚Äù includes an agent or compound which, when brought into contact with a cell or included in the culture medium of a cell, serves to enhance or increase unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added in the form of a concentrated solution or suspension (e.g., in a suitable solvent such as water or buffer) or in the form of a solid (e.g., in the form of a powder). Moreover, supplemental fatty acid biosynthetic substrates of the present invention can be added as a single aliquot, continuously or intermittently over a given period of time. The methodology of the present invention can further include a step of recovering a desired compound (e.g., an unsaturated fatty acid). The term ‚Äúrecovering‚Äù a desired compound includes extracting, harvesting, isolating or purifying the compound from culture media. Recovering the compound can be performed according to any conventional isolation or purification methodology known in the art including, but not limited to, treatment with a conventional resin (e.g, anion or cation exchange resin, non-ionic adsorption resin, etc.), treatment with a conventional adsorbent (e.g., activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina, etc.), alteration of pH, solvent extraction (e.g., with a conventional solvent such as an alcohol, ethyl acetate, hexane and the like), dialysis, filtration, concentration, crystallization, recrystallization, pH adjustment, lyophilization and the like. For example, a compound can be recovered from culture media by first removing the microorganisms from the culture. Media is then passed through or over a cation exchange resin to remove unwanted cations and then through or over an anion exchange resin to remove unwanted inorganic anions and organic acids having stronger acidities than the unsaturated fatty acid of interest (e.g., DHA). Preferably, a desired compound of the present invention is ‚Äúextracted,‚Äù ‚Äúisolated‚Äù or ‚Äúpurified‚Äù such that the resulting preparation is substantially free of other components (e.g., free of media components and/or fermentation byproducts). The language ‚Äúsubstantially free of other components‚Äù includes preparations of desired compound in which the compound is separated (e.g., purified or partially purified) from media components or fermentation byproducts of the culture from which it is produced. In one embodiment, the preparation has greater than about 80% (by dry weight) of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 20% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), more preferably greater than about 90% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 10% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), still more preferably greater than about 95% of the desired compound (e.g., less than about 5% of other media components or fermentation byproducts), and most preferably greater than about 98‚Äì99% desired compound (e.g., less than about 1‚Äì2% other media components or fermentation byproducts). When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to a salt, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the salt. When the desired compound is an unsaturated fatty acid that has been derivatized to an alcohol, the compound is preferably further free (e.g., substantially free) of chemical contaminants associated with the formation of the alcohol. In an alternative embodiment, the desired unsaturated fatty acid is not purified from the plant or microorganism, for example, when the plant or microorganism is biologically non-hazardous (e.g., safe). For example, the entire plant or culture (or culture supernatant) can be used as a source of product (e.g., crude product). In one embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) supernatant is used without modification. In another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is concentrated. In yet another embodiment, the plant or culture (or culture supernatant) is pulverized, dried, or lyophilized. B. High Yield Production Methodologies A particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention is a high yield production method for producing unsaturated fatty acids, e.g., DHA, comprising culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that the unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a significantly high yield. The phrase ‚Äúhigh yield production method,‚Äù for example, a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) includes a method that results in production of the desired compound at a level which is elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods. Preferably, a high yield production method results in production of the desired compound at a significantly high yield. The phrase ‚Äúsignificantly high yield‚Äù includes a level of production or yield which is sufficiently elevated or above what is usual for comparable production methods, for example, which is elevated to a level sufficient for commercial production of the desired product (e.g., production of the product at a commercially feasible cost). In one embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 2 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 10 g/L. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 20 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30 g/L. In yet another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 40 g/L. The invention further features a high yield production method for producing a desired compound (e.g., for producing an unsaturated fatty acid) that involves culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that a sufficiently elevated level of compound is produced within a commercially desirable period of time. In an exemplary embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 15‚Äì20 g/L in 36 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 25‚Äì30 g/L in 48 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acids produced at a level greater than 35‚Äì40 g/L in 72 hours, for example, greater that 37 g/L in 72 hours. In another embodiment, the invention features a high yield production method of producing unsaturated fatty acids that includes culturing a manipulated plant or microorganism under conditions such that an unsaturated fatty acid is produced at a level greater than 30‚Äì40 g/L in 60 hours, for example, greater that 30, 35 or 40 g/L in 60 hours. Values and ranges included and/or intermediate within the ranges set forth herein are also intended to be within the scope of the present invention. For example, unsaturated fatty acid production at levels of at least 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 g/L in 60 hours are intended to be included within the range of 30‚Äì40 g/L in 60 hours. In another example, ranges of 30‚Äì35 g/L or 35‚Äì40 g/L are intended to be included within the range of 30‚Äì40 g/L in 60 hours. Moreover, the skilled artisan will appreciate that culturing a manipulated microorganism to achieve a production level of, for example, ‚Äú30‚Äì40 g/L in 60 hours‚Äù includes culturing the microorganism for additional time periods (e.g., time periods longer than 60 hours), optionally resulting in even higher yields of an unsaturated fatty acid being produced. IV. Compositions The desaturase nucleic acid molecules, proteins, and fragments thereof, of the invention can be used to produce unsaturated fatty acids which can be incorporated into compositions. Compositions of the present invention include, e.g., compositions for use as animal feed, compositions for use as neutraceuticals (e.g., dietary supplements), and pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise an unsaturated fatty acid and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language ‚Äúpharmaceutically acceptable carrier‚Äù is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifingal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL‚Ñ¢ (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringeability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a LCPUFA, or a fragment thereof, produced by the nucleic acid and protein molecules of the present invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. For administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g, a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. In one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811. It is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects. The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of protein or polypeptide (i.e., an effective dosage) ranges from about 0.001 to 30 mg/kg body weight, preferably about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, and even more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg, 2 to 9 mg/kg, 3 to 8 mg/kg, 4 to 7 mg/kg, or 5 to 6 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a protein, polypeptide, or antibody can include a single treatment or, preferably, can include a series of treatments. In a preferred example, a subject is treated with a LCPUFA in the range of between about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg body weight, one time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, preferably between 2 to 8 weeks, more preferably between about 3 to 7 weeks, and even more preferably for about 4, 5, or 6 weeks. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of antibody, protein, or polypeptide used for treatment may increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent from the results of diagnostic assays as described herein. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. This invention is further illustrated by the following examples which should not be construed as limiting. The contents of all references, patents and published patent applications cited throughout this application, as well as the figures, are incorporated herein by reference. EXAMPLES Materials: Thraustochytrium s.p ATCC 21685 and Pythium irregulare were purchased from American type culture collection (12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md., 20852 USA) and grown in a medium (Weete, J. D., et al. (1997) Lipids 32:839‚Äì845) at 24¬∞ C. for 7days. After then biomass were harvested by centrifugation and used for RNA isolation. Example 1 Construction and Screening of cDNA Library Total RNA was isolated from the above materials according to Qiu and Erickson (Qiu, X. and Eriekson, L. (1994) Plant Mol. Biol. Repr. 12:209‚Äì214). The cDNA library was constructed from the total RNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase from Gibco-BRL. The second strand cDNA was synthesized by DNA polymerase I from Stratagene. After size fractionation, cDNA inserts larger than 1 kb were ligated into Œª Uni-Zap XR vector (Stratagene). The recombinant DNAs were then packed with Gigapack III Gold packaging extract (Stratagene) and plated on NZY plates. The resulting library represented more than 5√ó106 independent clones. Screening of the cDNA library was performed according to standard methods (Sambrook, J, Fritseh, E. F., Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular cloning‚ÄîA laboratory manual. (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., USA.) Example 2 RT-PCR The single strand cDNA was synthesized by superscript II reverse transcriptase (Gibco-BRL) from total RNA and was then used as the template for PCR reaction with two degenerate primers (The forward primer: GCXCA/GAXGAXCAC/TCCXGGXGG (SEQ ID NO:9) and the reverse primer: ATXTG/TXGGA/GAAXAG/AG/ATGG/ATG (SEQ ID NO:10)). The PCR amplification consisted of 35 cycles with 1 mm at 94¬∞ C., 1.5 mm at 55¬∞ C. and 2 mm at 72¬∞ C. followed by an extension step at 72¬∞ C. for 10 mm. The amplified products from 800 bp to 1000 bp were isolated from agarose gel and purified by a kit (Qiaex II gel purification, Qiagen), and subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR¬Æ2.1 (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were then sequenced by PRISM DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). Example 3 Expression of FAD4, FAD5, FAD5-2, and FAD6 in Yeast The open reading frames of Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6 were amplified by PCR using the Precision Plus enzyme (Stratagene) and cloned into a TA cloning vector (pCR¬Æ2.1, Invitrogen). Having confirmed that the PCR products were identical to the original cDNAs by sequencing, the fragments were then released by a BarnHI-EcoRI double digestion and inserted into the yeast expression vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) under the control of the inducible promoter GAL1 . Yeast strains InvSc2 (Invitrogen) was transformed with the expression constructs using the lithium acetate method and transformants were selected on minimal medium plates lacking uracil (Gietz, D., et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res. 20:1425; Covello, P. S. and Reed, D. W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223‚Äì226). Transformants were first grown in minimal medium lacking uracil and containing glucose at 28¬∞ C. After overnight culture, the cells were spun down, washed and resuspended in distilled water. Minimal medium containing 2% galactose, with or without 0.3 mM substrate fatty acids in the presence of 0.1% tergitol, was inoculated with the yeast transformant cell suspension and incubated at 20¬∞ C. for three days, and then 15¬∞ C. for another three days. Example 4 Fatty Acid Analysis Thraustochytrium, Pythium irregulare and yeast cells were harvested and washed twice with distilled water. Then 2 mL methanolic KOH (7.5% w/v KOH in 95% methanol) was added to the materials and the mixture sealed in a 12 ml glass culture tube was heated to 80¬∞ C. for 2 hours. 0.5 mL water was added and the sample was extracted twice with 2 mL hexane to remove the non-saponifiable lipids. The remaining aqueous phase was then acidified by adding 1 mL 6 N HCl and extracted twice with 2 mL hexane. The hexane phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. 2 mL 3 N methanolic HCl (SUPELCO, Supelco Park, Bellefonte, Pa. 16823‚Äì0048) was added and the mixture was heated at 80¬∞ C. for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature, 1 mL 0.9% NaCl was added and the mixture extracted twice with 2√ó2 mL hexane. The combined hexane was evaporated under nitrogen. The resulting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS according to Covello & Reed (Covello, P. S. and Reed, D. W. (1996) Plant Physiol. 111:223‚Äì226). GC/MS analysis was performed in standard El mode using a Fisons VG TRIO 2000 mass spectrometer (VG Analytical, UK) controlled by Masslynx version 2.0 software, coupled to a GC 8000 Series gas chromatograph. A DB-23 column (30M√ó0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 Ilm film thickness, J&W Scientific, Folsom, Calif.) that was temperature-programmed at 180¬∞ C. for 1 min, then 4 C /min to 240¬∞ C. and held for 15 minutes, was used for FAME analysis. Example 5 Transformation of Brassica Juncea and Flax (Linum Usitatissimum) and Exogenous Fatty Acid Treatment The hypocotyls of 5‚Äì6 day seedlings of B. juncea and flax were used as explants for inoculation with the Agrobacterium tumefaciens that hosts binary vectors with the full-length cDNAs under the control of the different promoters. The 20-day transgenic seedlings were used for exogenous fatty acid treatment. The seedling was divided into three parts: leaves, stems and roots. Each was cut into the small pieces and placed in a 24-well titer plate. To each well, 2 mL 0.05% sodium salt of substrates (NuCheck Prep Inc., Elysian, Minn.) was added. The plate was then incubated at 24¬∞ C. for 4 h with gentle shaking. After incubation, the plant tissues were washed three times with water and then used for fatty acid analysis. Example 6 Fatty Acid Profile of the Thrauschytrium Sp. Thraustochytrium and Pythium irregulare have recently drawn scientific attention due to its ability in production of LCPUFAs such as DHA, AA, EPA and DPA. FIGS. 23 and 24 show the fatty acid composition of the lipids isolated from 7 day cultures of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , respectively. As shown in the tables, the microorganisms contain a broad range of polyunsaturated fatty acids, from both n-3 and n-6 families, from 1 8-carbon Œî6 fatty acids (gamma-linolenic acid and steardonic acid) to 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids (DHA and DPA). The organisms, especially Thraustochytrium sp., appear to contain a full-set of desaturation and elongation enzymes required for the DHA and DPA biosynthesis. The strain lacks 24-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids, the proposed precursors for DHA and DPA synthesis in Precher's pathway (Voss, A., et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266:19995‚Äì20000; Mohammed, B.S., et al. (1997) Biochem. J. 326:425‚Äì430). The 24-carbon fatty acid may not be involved in in vivo synthesis of 22-carbon Œî4 fatty acids such as DHA and DPA in Thraustochytrium sp. Example 7 Identification of cDNAS Coding for the ‚ÄúFront-End‚Äù Desaturase To identify genes coding for desaturases involved in biosynthesis of LCFUFAs in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , a PCR-based cloning strategy was adopted. Two degenerate primers are designed to target the heme-binding motif of N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in front-end desaturases and the third conservative histidine motif in all microsomal desaturases, respectively. The rational behind the design is that the desaturases involved in EPA and DHA biosynthesis in Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , should have similar primary structure as other front-end desaturases, i.e. N-terminal extension of cyt b5-like domain in the desaturase. Four cDNAs fragments were identified from Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare that encode fusion proteins containing cyt b5-like domain in the N-terminus. To isolate full-length cDNA clones, the four inserts were used as probes to screen cDNA libraries of Thraustochytrium sp. and Pythium irregulare , which resulted in identification of several cDNA clones in each group. Sequencing of all those clones identified four full-length cDNAs which were named as Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2 and Fad6. The open reading frame of Fad4 is 1560 bp and codes for 519 amino acids with molecular weight of 59.1 kDa ( FIG. 1 ). Fad5 is 1230 bp in length and codes for 439 amino acids with molecular weight of 49.8 kDa ( FIG. 2 ). A sequence comparison of these two sequences from Thraustochytrium sp. showed only 16% amino acid identity between the deduced proteins. A detailed analysis revealed that Fad4 is 80 amino acids longer than Fad5, occurring between the second and third conservative histidine motifs ( FIG. 3 ). The open reading frame of Fad5-2 from Pythium irregulare is 1371 bp and codes for 456 amino acids ( FIG. 4 ). Fad6 from Pythium irregulare is 1383 bp in length and codes for 460 amino acids ( FIG. 5 ). Sequence comparison of the two sequences from Pythium irregulare showed over 39% similarity between the deduced proteins ( FIG. 6 ). A BLASTP‚Ñ¢ search of the protein database revealed the following hits for each of the four proteins, Fad4, Fad5, Fad5-2, and Fad6: Fad 4 (519 amino acid residues)Blastp nrAccessionNo.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF067654Mortierella alpinaŒî5 fatty acid50929desaturaseAF054824Mortierella alpinaŒî5 microsomal50928desaturaseAB022097DictyosteliumŒî5 fatty acid50727discoideumdesaturaseAB029311Dictyosteliumfatty acid51926discoideumdesaturaseL11421Synechocystis sp.Œî6 desaturase41025D90914 Fad 5 (439 amino acid residues)Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF139720Euglena gracilisŒî8 fatty acid40429desaturaseAF007561Borago officinalisŒî6 desaturase42127U79010Borago officinalisŒî6 desaturase42127AF309556Danio rerioŒî6 fatty acid42226desaturaseAF110510MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid46325alpinadesaturase Fad 5-2 (456 amino acid residues)Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAB029311DictosteliumFatty acid44341discoideumdesaturaseAB022097DictosteliumŒî5 fatty acid44539discoideumdesaturaseAF067654MortierellaŒî5 fatty acid44138alpinadesaturaseAF054824MortierellaŒî5 microsomal44138alpinadesaturaseL11421Synechocystis sp.Œî6 desaturase36128D90914 Fad 6 (459 amino acid residues)Blastp nrAccession No.OrganismDescriptionLength% IdentityAF110510MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43738alpinadesaturaseAB020032MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43738alpinadesaturaseAF306634MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43738isabellinadesaturaseAF307940MortierellaŒî6 fatty acid43838alpinadesaturaseAJ250735CeratodonŒî6 fatty acid43836purpureusdesaturase Example 8 Expression of FAD4, FAD5, FAD5-2, and FAD6 in Yeast To confirm the function of Fad4, the full-length cDNA was expressed in the yeast strain InvSc2 under the control of the inducible promoter. FIG. 7 shows that with supplementation of the medium with 22:5 (7,10,13,16,19), yeast cells containing Fad4 cDNA had an extra fatty acid as compared to the vector control. The peak has a retention time identical to the DHA standard. LC/MS analysis of the free fatty acid showed that it yields deprotonated molecular ions (m/z=279) identical to the DHA standard in negative ion electrospray. Moreover, GC/MS analysis of the FAME confirmed that the spectrum of the peak is identical to that of the DHA standard ( FIG. 8 ). These results indicate that Fad4 is a Œî4 fatty acid desaturase which is able to introduce a double bond at position 4 of the 22:5(7,10,13,16,19) substrate, resulting in a Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DHA (22:6‚Äì4,7,10,13,16,19). To further study the substrate specificity of the Fad4, a number of substrates including 18:2(9,12), 18:3(9,12,15), 20:3(8,11,14) and 22:4(7,10,13,16) were separately supplied to the yeast transformants. The results indicated Fad4 could also use 22:4 (7,10,13,16) as a substrate ( FIG. 9 ) to produce another Œî4 desaturated fatty acid, DPA (22:5‚Äì4,7,10,13,16) ( FIG. 10 ). The rest of the fatty acids examined were not effective substrates. To confirm the function of Fad5 and Fad5-2, the S. cerevisiae Invsc2 was transformed with plasmids, which contain the open reading frame of the Fad5 and Fad5-2 respectively under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter. When the yeast transformants were induced by galactose in a medium containing homo-gamma-linolenic acid (HGLA, 20:3‚Äì8,11,14), an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 11 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the fatty acid had a retention time identical to the arachidonic acid standard (AA, 20:4‚Äì5,8,11,14). To further confirm the regiochemistry of the products, the FAMEs were analyzed by GC/MS. FIG. 12 indicates that the mass spectra of the new fatty acid and the AA standard are identical. These results demonstrate that Fad5 and Fad5-2 convert HGLA (20:3‚Äì8,11,13) into AA (20:4‚Äì5,8,11,14) in yeast. To further study the substrate specificity of Fad5-2, the plasmid containing Fad5-2 was transferred into another yeast strain AMY-2Œ± where ole1, a Œî9 desaturase gene, is disrupted. The strain is unable to grow in minimal media without supplementation with mono-unsaturated fatty acids. In this experiment, the strain was grown in minimal medium supplemented with 17:1(10Z), a non-substrate of Fad5-2, which enabled study of the specificity of the enzyme towards various substrates, especially monounsaturates. A number of possible substrates including 16:1(9Z), 18:1(9Z), 18:1(11Z), 18:1(11E), 18:1(12E), 18:1(15Z), 18:2(9Z,12Z), 18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z), 20:2(11Z,14Z) and 20:3(11Z,14Z,17Z) were tested. Results indicated that Fad5-2 could desaturate unsaturated fatty acids with Œî9 ethylenic and Œî11 ethylenic double bonds, as well as the fatty acid with Œî8 ethylenic double bond (20:3‚Äì8,11,14). As shown in FIG. 13 , Fad5-2 effectively converted both 18:1 (9Z) and 18:1 (11Z) substrates into their corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids, 18:2‚Äì5,9 (the retention time 10.34 min) and 18:1‚Äì5,11 (the retention time 10.44 min), respectively. Fad5-2 also desaturated trans fatty acid such as 18:1(11E) and 18:1(12E). FIG. 25 is a comparison of substrate preference of Fad5-2 for fatty acid substrates tested in the yeast strain AMY-2Œ±. The relative proportions of the substrates and the products accumulated are a useful indicator of substrate preference of the enzyme. As shown in FIG. 25 , Fad5-2 prefers fatty acids with 20-carbon as substrates, such as 20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z), 20:3(11Z,14Z, 17Z) and 20:2(11Z,14Z). Whereas, the shorter shorter chain fatty acid is a relatively weaker substrate for the enzyme in yeast. To confirm the function of Fad6, the S. cerevisiae host strain Invsc2 was transformed with a plasmid containing the open reading frame of Fad6 under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter, GAL1. When the yeast transformant was induced by galactose in a medium containing linoleic acid, an extra peak was observed in the chromatogram of the FAMEs accumulating in the transformants compared with the control ( FIG. 14 ). A comparison of the chromatogram with that of the standards revealed that the peak had a retention time identical to the gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, 18:3‚Äì6,9,12) standard. To confirm the regioselectivity of the products, the diethylamine derivatives of fatty acids from the expressing strain were analyzed by GC-MS. FIG. 15 shows that the new peak is indeed GLA with three double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions. Major fragments of n and n+1 carbons differing by 12 D are diagnostic of a double bond between carbon n+1 and n+2. Thus, the fragments at 156 and 168, 196 and 208, and 236 and 248, indicate double bonds at the Œî6, Œî9, and Œî12 positions, respectively. These results demonstrate that Fad6 is a Œî6 desaturase that converts linoleic acid (18:2) to GLA in yeast. Example 9 Expression OF FAD4 in B. Juncea To determine whether Traustochytrium Fad4 is functional in oilseed crops, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad4 under the control of a constitutive promoter. Eight independent transgenic plants were obtained. In B. juncea there is no Œî4 fatty acid desaturase substrates available. Thus, to examine the activity of the transgenic enzyme in the plants, the 22:5 (n-3) substrate must be exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium docosapentaeneate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of both types of plants, but converted into DHA only in transgenics. Leaves have a higher level of production of DHA than roots and stems. In leaves, the exogenous substrate was incorporated to a level of 10‚Äì20% of the total fatty acids and Œî4 desaturated fatty acid (22:6, n-3) was produced in a range of 3‚Äì6% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 16 ). These results indicate that the Œî4 fatty acid desaturase from Traustochytrium is functional in oilseed crops. Example 10 Expression of Fad5-2 in B. juncea To determine whether Fad5-2 is functional in oilseed crops and its expression has any effect on their growth and development, B. juncea were transformed with a binary vector that contained Fad5-2 cDNA behind a constitutive promoter (a tandem cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter). Six independent primary transgenic plants were obtained and the fatty acid profile of lipids from different tissues was determined. FIG. 17 shows the fatty acid composition of three-week-old seedling plants from one T 1 line. Compared with wild type, all transgenic plant tissues have an altered fatty acid profile containing four additional peaks which were identified as four different Œî5-undesaturated polymethylene-interrupted fatty acids (Œî5-UPIFAs), specifically, taxoleic (18:2‚Äì5,9); ephedrenic (18:2‚Äì5,11); pinolenic (18:3‚Äì5,9,12), and coniferonic acids (18:4‚Äì5,9,12,15). Thus B. juncea , like yeast, can functionally express the P. irregulare Œî5 desaturase to convert the endogenous substrates 18:1‚Äì9; 18:1‚Äì11; 18:2‚Äì9,12, and 18:3‚Äì9,12,15 to the corresponding Œî5 desaturated fatty acids. The roots produced the highest amount of the Œî5-UPIFAs, representing more than 20% of the total fatty acids, followed by 6% in stems and 5% in leaves ( FIG. 17 ). In B. juncea there is no homo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3‚Äì8,11,14) substrate available. Thus, to examine whether the transgenic plant can produce AA, the substrate 20:3(8,11,14) was exogenously supplied. In this experiment, both wild type and transgenics were applied with an aqueous solution of sodium homo-gamma-linolenate. It was found that exogenously applied substrates were readily taken up by roots, stem, and leaves of transgenic plants and converted into AA in plants ( FIG. 18 ). There was no observable phenotypic effect on the growth and development in the transgenic B. juncea , although the Œî5-UPIFAs accumulated in all parts of the plant. Growth and differentiation of vegetative tissues such as the leaves, stems, and roots were indistinguishable from the corresponding wild type. To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in seeds, B. juncea were transformed with the construct containing Fad5-2 cDNA behind a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Fatty acid analysis of transgenic seeds showed that there were two new fatty acids appearing in the gas chromatogram of transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 19 ). They were identified as taxoleic acid (18:2‚Äì5,9) and pinolenic acids (18:3‚Äì5,9,12). Together, these fatty acids represent 9.4% of the seed fatty acids. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs has no significant effect on the oleic acid content compared with the untransformed control. Example 11 Expression of Fad5-2 in Flax To produce Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, flax was transformed with Fad5-2 under the control of two seed-specific promoters, a heterologous B. napus napin promoter, and a flax endogenous promoter. As shown in FIG. 26 , transgenic plants containing the napin promoter produced one Œî5 desaturated fatty acid, taxoleic acid in seeds at the level of less than 1% of the total fatty acids. Whereas transgenic plants containing the flax seed-specific promoter produced three Œî5 desaturated fatty acids: taxoleic, pinolenic, and coniferonic acid. Of these, taxoleic (18:2‚Äì5,9) was the most abundant and accounted for more than 9% of the total fatty acids in a elite line (FN-10-1), followed by coniferonic and pinolenic acids. Surprisingly, accumulation of Œî5 desaturated fatty acids in transgenic seeds has significant impact on the composition of other fatty acids, especially the oleic acid level. Accumulation of Œî5-UPIFAs was accompanied by a huge increase of the oleic acids in both types of transgenic plants expressing Fad5-2 desaturase under the control of the different promoters. The content of oleic acid in transgenic plants with the napin and flax seed-specific promoters, on the average, reached 44.7% and 24.3% of the total fatty acids, respectively, relative to the untransformed control at 17.4%. Example 12 Expression of Fad6 in Flax To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in flax seeds, two types of flax were transformed with the construct that contains Fad6 cDNA under the control of a heterologous seed-specific promoter ( B. napus napin promoter). Type I flax (Normandy) is a traditional industrial oilseed crop, whereas Type II (Solin) is an edible oilseed crop derived from chemical mutagenesis of Type I. A total of twelve transgenic plants were produced. The majority of transgenics exhibited two novel fatty acids whose retention times correspond to GLA and SDA and they constitute 0.1 to 4.3% of the total fatty acids ( FIG. 27 ). The level of GLA in transgenic Solin type is higher than that of SDA, while GLA in transgenic Normandy is lower than SDA. This is understandable because linoleic acid is a major fatty acid in Solin type linseed while Œ±-linolenic acid is a major fatty acid in Normandy seeds. Example 13 Expression of Fad6 in B. Juncea To produce Œî6 desaturated fatty acids in seeds of B. juncea, B. juncea were transformed with the same construct used in flax transformation, i.e., Fad6 under the control of the B. napus napin promoter. Fifteen independent transgenic plants were obtained. Fatty acid analysis of the transgenic seeds showed that there were three new fatty acids in the gas chromatogram of most transgenics compared with the wild type control ( FIG. 20 ). The three fatty acids were identified as 18:2(6,9) and 18:3(6,9,12), and 18:4(6,9,12,15). B. juncea , like flax, can also flnctionally express Fad6 from P. irregulare , introducing a double bond at position 6 of endogenous substrate 18:1(9), 18:2(9,12), and 18:3(6,9,12) resulting in production of three corresponding Œî6 fatty acids in the transgenic seeds. Among the three new fatty acids produced in transgenic seeds, GLA is the most abundant one, with a level in transgenic seeds of 30% to 38% of the total fatty acids. The next most abundant component is SDA, which accounts for 3‚Äì10% of the total fatty acids in several transgenic lines ( FIG. 21 ). The fatty acid compositions of transgenic seeds are shown in FIG. 22 . It is clear that the high level production of Œî6 desaturated fatty acids is at the cost of two major fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic acids. Proportions of oleic and stearic acids in transgenics are slightly reduced, but not significantly compared to those in the wild type control. The content of linoleic acid in the transgenics was dramatically reduced. In the untransformed wild type, linoleic acid accounts for more than 40% of the total fatty acids in seeds. In transgenics, the level was reduced to less than 10%. As compared to the reduction of linoleic acid in transgenics, the decrease in linolenic acid in transgenics is less dramatic, but still significant. In the untransformed wild type, linolenic acid accounts for more than 10% of the total fatty acids in seeds while in transgenics the level was reduced to less than 5%. The two dramatically reduced fatty acids in transgenic seeds are the substrates of the Œî6 desaturase, and the reduction is the cost for producing two corresponding Œî6 desaturated fatty acids.

osteoarthritis in particular. More specifically, it relates to the use of FGF-18 in treatment regimens and for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of patients having a cartilage disorder such as osteoarthritis, such as for example knee osteoarthritis or secondary hip osteoarthritis. Specifically provided is a preferred treatment scheme comprising once weekly administration of an FGF-18 compound per treatment cycle. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FGF18 was identified as a member of the FGF family which was most closely related to FGF8 and FGF17. Activities associated with FGF18 include stimulation of mesenchymal lineage cells, in particular cardiac myocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes ( U.S. Patent No. 6,352,971 ). FGF18 binds and activates FGFR4 and the IIIc splice variant of FGFR3 and FGFR2. Bone remodeling is the dynamic process by which tissue mass and skeletal architecture are maintained. The process is a balance between bone resorption and bone formation, with two cell types thought to be the major players. These cells are the osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts synthesize and deposit matrix to become new bone. The activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are regulated by many factors, systemic and local, including growth factors. Cartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. It is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are dispersed in a firm, gel-like ground substance, called the matrix. Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, in the throat and between intervertebral disks. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. The main purpose of cartilage is to provide a framework upon which bone deposition could begin. Another important purpose of cartilage is to provide smooth surfaces and mechanical protection for the movement of articulating bones. Replacement of damaged cartilage, in particular articular cartilage, caused either by injury or disease is a major challenge for physicians, and available treatments are considered unpredictable and effective for only a limited time. Virtually all currently available treatments for cartilage damage focus on pain relief, with little or no efficacy on regeneration of damaged tissues. Therefore, the majority of younger patients either do not seek treatment or are counseled to postpone treatment for as long as possible. When treatment is required, the standard procedure is total joint replacement or microfracture, a procedure that involves penetration of the subchondral bone to stimulate fibrocartilage deposition by chondrocytes. For patients with osteoarthritis, non-surgical treatment consists of physical therapy, lifestyle modification (e.g. reducing activity), bracing, supportive devices, oral and injection drugs (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and medical management. Surgical options are very specific to osteoarthritis severity and can provide a reduction in symptoms that are generally only short lived. Tibial or femoral osteotomics (cutting the bone to rebalance joint wear) may reduce symptoms, help to maintain an active lifestyle, and delay the need for total joint replacement. Total joint replacement can provide relief for the symptom of advanced osteoarthritis, but generally requires a change in a patient\\'s lifestyle and/or activity level. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method for treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of cartilage disorders that would permit regeneration of damaged tissue. In addition, it would be desirable that such method be as safe and effective as possible. Moreover, as cartilage disorders may be chronic diseases, it would be desirable that such method permits re-treatments of the patient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a medical use for treating a patient having a cartilage disorder comprising the administration of an FGF-18 compound wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the cartilage disorder to be treated is osteoarthritis, the FGF-18 compound is the FGF-18 fragment designated herein as FGF-18(170AA) and the posology cycle is 10 to 30 mcg per intra-articular injection once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (one treatment cycle). In a preferred embodiment such treatment cycles may be repeated after 4 or 6 months. For example, where a treatment cycle is repeated after 6 months, if a first treatment cycle is started e.g. in January of a given year, then a second treatment cycle may be started in July of said year. Further provided herein is the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. Also provided herein is the use of an FGF-18 compound for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein, the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. Provided herein is also the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder, the medicament being adapted to be administered at least two times, said administrations being separated 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides suitable treatment modalities, including suitable administration schemes for the treatment of various cartilage disorders, such as in particular osteoarthritis, with FGF-18 compounds, such as for example the FGF-18(170AA) protein fragment. In the context of the present invention it has been surprisingly found that FGF-18 compounds have optimal disease- or symptom-ameliorating effects on cartilage disorders when administered according to the methods and uses disclosed herein. It has been found that less frequent dosing schedules than contemplated by the present invention may not be fully effective, whereas more frequent dosing than contemplated by the present invention may cause inflammation and/or other counterproductive effects on the cartilage or joint environment when the same or comparable dosages as those contemplated by the present invention are being used. Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for treating a patient having a cartilage disorder comprising the administration of an FGF-18 compound wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by 7 days. In another aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by 7 days. In a preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by 7 days each. Preferably, the FGF-18 compound is administered in regular intervals once per week. In an embodiment of the present invention there is provided the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder the medicament being adapted to be administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by 7 days.

In a preferred embodiment the treatment comprises administration at a dose of 80, 90, 100, 110 or 120 mcg/kg per single intravenous administration of the FGF-18 compound. In a preferred embodiment the cartilage disorder treated by any of the methods of the invention is osteoarthritis, such as for example osteoarthritis which is classified as stage II or stage III according to OARSI. In a preferred example the osteoarthritis may be knee osteoarthritis or hip osteoarthritis, such as secondary hip osteoarthritis. The skilled person is fully aware of osteoarthritis classifications that are used in the art. In particular, the OARSI classification is known in the art. The skilled person may reference the \" Guidelines for the medical management of osteoarthritis\" (Marc C. Hochberg, Roy D. Altman, Kenneth D. Brandt, Bruce M. Clark, Paul A. Dieppe, Marie R. Griffin, Roland W. Moskowitz, Thomas J. Schnitzer, Arthritis & Rheumatism, Volume 38, Issue 11, 1995. Pages 1535-1546 .) Preferred FGF-18 compounds of the invention are selected from human wildtype FGF-18 or FGF-18(170AA). Compounds of the invention Native or wildtype FGF-18 is a protein expressed by chondrocytes of articular cartilage. The present invention generally relates to the use of an Fibroblast Growth Factor 18 (FGF-18) compound in the treatment of osteoarthritis. An FGF-18 compound of the invention includes for example native or wildtype FGF-18, in particular human FGF-18, bioactive variants thereof, such as bioactive allelic variants, and bioactive truncated forms of FGF-18. The present invention may relate to any variant or modified from of FGF-18 which retains the desired FGF-18 bioactivity as herein described, such as in particular the increase in cartilage deposition. Bioactivities of FGF-18 include in particular those described in the Examples hereinbelow, such as in particular in the in vivo disease models described herein. The nucleotide sequence of the human FGF-18 cDNA is described in SEQ ID NO. 1, and its deduced amino acid sequence is described in SEQ ID NO. 2. FGF18 was originally designated zFGF-5, and is fully described in U. S. Patents  US6,352,971 ,  US5,989,866  and US Patent Application Publication  US2005/0043234 , all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Analysis of the cDNA encoding a human FGF18 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 1) revealed an open reading frame encoding 207 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 2) comprising a mature polypeptide of 180 amino acids (residue 28 to residue 207 of SEQ ID NO: 2). The mouse FGF-18 polynucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 and corresponding amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 were found to have a high degree of homology to that of the human ortholog. At the amino acid level, the mouse and human polypeptides are approximately 98% identical, with three amino acid changes. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the sequences disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4 represent a single allele of the human and mouse FGF18 gene and polypeptide, respectively, and that allelic variation and alternative splicing are expected to occur. As already mentioned, FGF-18 compound of the invention includes for example native or wildtype FGF-18, in particular human FGF-18, bioactive variants thereof, such as bioactive allelic variants, and bioactive truncated forms of FGF-18. The present invention may relate to any variant or modified from of FGF-18 which retains the desired FGF-18 bioactivity as herein described, such as in particular the increase in cartilage deposition. In an embodiment of the present invention FGF-18 compound is a truncated form of human FGF-18. In a particular embodiment said truncated form of FGF-18 comprises or consists of residues 28 to 175 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a functional derivative, or variant or mutein as defined herein. In another embodiment said truncated form of FGF-18 comprises or consists of residues 28 to 176, 28 to 177, 28 to 178, 28 to 179, 28 to 180, 28 to 181, 28 to 182, 28 to 183, 28 to 184, 28 to 185, 28 to 186, 28 to 187, 28 to 188, 28 to 189, 28 to 190, 28 to 191, 28 to 192, 28 to 193, 28 to 194 or 28 to 195, 28 to 196, 28 to 197, 28 to 198, 28 to 199, 28 to 200, 28 to 201, 28 to 202, 28 to 203, 28 to 204, 28 to 205, 28 to 206 or 28 to 207 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a functional derivative, or a variant or mutein as defined herein. These polypeptides, functional derivative, or variant or mutein may comprise an additional N-terminal amino acid residue, preferably a methionine. Indeed, depending on the expression system and conditions, polypeptides of the invention may be expressed in a recombinant host cell with a starting Methionine. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a truncated form of FGF-18, containing 170 amino acids (AA), hereinafter also designated as \"FGF-18(170AA)\". The wild type or naturally occurring form is 207 AA long of which the first 27 AA are the signal sequence and the last 11 AA are deleted in FGF-18(170AA) (as can be demonstrated also for natural occurring FGF-18  in vivo ). FGF-18(170AA) may be expressed in  E.coli,  as there is no signal sequence and the AA sequence starts with a methionine followed by AA28 and ends with AA196. The molecular weight of FGF-18(170AA) is 19.83 kDa, pl ~ 10. FGF-18(170AA) is further described in SEQ ID NO. 5 hereinbelow. FGF-18(170AA) increases chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation and cartilage deposition leading to repair and reconstruction for a variety of cartilaginous tissues. Members of the FGF family are characterized by heparin binding domains. A putative heparin-binding domain for FGF-18 has been identified in the region of amino acid residue 148 (Gly) to amino acid residue 169 (Gln) of SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4. It is postulated that receptor-mediated signaling is initiated upon binding of FGF ligand complexed with cell-surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Many FGF family members can be placed into one of two related families on the basis of their structures and functions. aFGF and bFGF consist of three exons separated by two introns of variable length. FGF-18 consists of five exons, the first three of which correspond to the first exon of aFGF and bFGF. All known FGF family members are spliced to form single polypeptides. Analysis of the ligand-receptor complex of FGF-18 has demonstrated that FGF18 has specificity for FGFR4 and the \"IIIc\" splice variants of FGFR3 and FGFR2. FGFR3-IIIc and FGFR2-IIIc are expressed by chondrocytes of cartilage tissue, and in particular, both receptors have been found within human articular cartilage. FGFR3 and FGFR2 have been found in the growth plate of mammals and play important roles in the formation of endochondral and intramembranous bone. FGFR2 is first expressed in condensing mesenchyme and FGFR3 expression is initiated as chondrocytes differentiate and proliferate. In developing cranial bones, FGFR3 is found in the dura mater and periosteum, whereas FGFR2 is expressed in osteoprogenitor cells at the osteogenic front separating the sutures. FGFR2 is also expressed in traebecular bone. Previously, it has been shown that FGF18 is a proliferative agent for chondrocytes and osteoblasts, depending upon both the differentiated state of these cell types and the mode of administration. (See,  U. S. Patents 6,352, 971  and  5,989, 866 ;  Ellsworth et al. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, 10: 308-320,2002  ;  Shimoaka et al. , J. Bio. Chem. 277 (9) 7493-500,2002 ). Preferably, the FGF-18 compound of the invention increases cartilage deposition. Such increase may be measured both in vivo and in vitro. Generation of hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage are valuable both as a therapeutic and as component for biological matrices. FGF-18 compounds, such as FGF-18(170AA), and compositions containing FGF-18 compounds (\"FGF-18 compositions\") will be useful in treating articular cartilage defects in synovial joints that are due to age-related superficial fibrillation, cartilage degeneration due to osteoarthritis, and focal chondral and osteochondral defects due to injury or disease. FGF-18 compounds and compositions may also be useful for treating joint disease caused by osteochondritis dissecans and degenerative joint disease. In the field of reconstructive and plastic surgery, FGF-18 compositions will be useful for autogenous or allogenic cartilage expansion and transfer for reconstruction of extensive tissue defects. FGF-18 compounds and compositions may also be useful to expand cells and induce elastic cartilage production. Expansions of cells and induction of elastic cartilage production will be useful for generation and repair of ear and nose tissue. FGF-18 compounds and compositions can also be used to expand chondrocyte populations in culture for autogenous or allogenic chondrocyte transplantation and then administered with or without concurrent treatment consisting of administration of FGF-18 compositions. In these procedures, for example, chondrocytes can be harvested arthroscopically from an uninjured minor load-bearing area of the damaged joint, and can be cultured in the presence of FGF18 compositions to increase the number of cells prior to transplantation. The expanded cultures will then be admixed with FGF-18 compositions, and placed in the joint space or directly into the defect. FGF-18 compositions can be used in combination with periosteal or perichondrial grafts that contain cells that can form cartilage and/or help to hold the transplanted chondrocytes or their precursor cells in place. FGF-18 compositions can be used to repair cartilage damage in conjunction with lavage of the joint, stimulation of bone marrow, abrasion arthroplasty, subchondral drilling, or microfracture of the subchondral bone. Additionally, after the growth of cartilage due to the administration of the FGF-18 composition, additional surgical treatment may be necessary to suitably contour the newly formed cartilage surface. An FGF-18 compound according to the present invention may also be a functional derivative, variant or mutein of a wildtype FGF-18 protein. \"Functional derivatives\" as used herein cover derivatives of FGF-18, and its variants or muteins and fused proteins, which may be prepared from the functional groups which occur as side chains on the residues or the N or C terminal groups, by means known in the art. These functional derivatives are included in the invention as long as they remain pharmaceutically acceptable, i.e. they do not destroy the activity of the protein, which is substantially similar to, or better than, the activity of FGF-18, and do not confer toxic properties on compositions containing it. These derivatives may, for example, include polyethylene glycol side chains, which may improve other properties of the protein, such as stability, half-life, bioavailability, tolerance by the human body, or reduce immunogenicity. To achieve this goal, FGF-18 may be linked e.g. to Polyethlyenglycol (PEG). PEGylation may be carried out by known methods, as for example described in  WO 92/13095 . In particular, PEG-IFN can be prepared in accordance with the teaching of  WO 99/55377 . \\nTherefore, in a preferred embodiment, the functional derivative of FGF-18 comprises at least one moiety attached to one or more functional groups, which occur as one or more side chains on the amino acid residues. An embodiment in which the moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety is highly preferred. In accordance with the present invention, several PEG moieties may also be attached to the FGF-18. \\nOther derivatives include a modified FGF-18 protein, such as a long-acting form of FGF-18. In particular, the long-acting FGF-18 may be selected from pegylated FGF-18, FGF-18-HAS fusion proteins, and FGF-18-Fc-fusion proteins. \\nOther derivatives include aliphatic esters of the carboxyl groups, amides of the carboxyl groups by reaction with ammonia or with primary or secondary amines, N-acyl derivatives of free amino groups of the amino acid residues formed with acyl moieties (e.g. alkanoyl or carbocyclic aroyl groups) or O-acyl derivatives of free hydroxyl groups (for example that of seryl or threonyl residues) formed with acyl moieties. \"Variants\" or \"muteins\", as used in the frame of the present invention, refer to analogs of FGF-18, in which one or more of the amino acid residues of natural FGF-18 are replaced by different amino acid residues, or are deleted, or one or more amino acid residues are added to the natural sequence of FGF-18, without diminishing considerably the activity of the resulting products as compared with the wild type FGF-18. These muteins are prepared by known synthesis and/or by site-directed mutagenesis techniques, or any other known technique suitable therefor. \\nThe \"variant\" or \"mutein\" in accordance with the present invention include proteins encoded by a nucleic acid, such as DNA or RNA, which hybridizes to DNA or RNA encoding FGF-18 as disclosed e.g. in  US 5,989,866  under stringent conditions. The term \"stringent conditions\" refers to hybridization and subsequent washing conditions, which those of ordinary skill in the art conventionally refer to as \"stringent\". See  Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Interscience, N.Y., ¬ß¬ß6.3 and 6.4 (1987, 1992 ). Without limitation, examples of stringent conditions include washing conditions 12-20¬∞C below the calculated Tm of the hybrid under study in, e.g., 2 x SSC and 0.5% SDS for 5 minutes, 2 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS for 15 minutes; 0.1 x SSC and 0.5% SDS at 37¬∞C for 30 60 minutes and then, a 0.1 x SSC and 0.5% SDS at 68¬∞C for 30-60 minutes. Those of ordinary skill in this art understand that stringency conditions also depend on the length of the DNA sequences, oligonucleotide probes (such as 10-40 bases) or mixed oligonucleotide probes. If mixed probes are used, it is preferable to use tetramethyl ammonium chloride (TMAC) instead of SSC. See Ausubel, supra. \\nIdentity reflects a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, determined by comparing the sequences. In general, identity refers to an exact nucleotide to nucleotide or amino acid to amino acid correspondence of the two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences, respectively, over the length of the sequences being compared. \\nFor sequences where there is not an exact correspondence, a \"% identity\" may be determined. In general, the two sequences to be compared are aligned to give a maximum correlation between the sequences. This may include inserting \"gaps\" in either one or both sequences, to enhance the degree of alignment. A % identity may be determined over the whole length of each of the sequences being compared (so-called global alignment), that is particularly suitable for sequences of the same or very similar length, or over shorter, defined lengths (so-called local alignment), that is more suitable for sequences of unequal length. Methods for comparing the identity and homology and/or similarity of two or more sequences are well known in the art. Thus for instance, programs available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, version 9.1 (Devereux J et al., 1984), for example the programs BESTFIT and GAP, may be used to determine the % identity between two polynucleotides and the % identity and the % homology between two polypeptide sequences. BESTFIT uses the \"local homology\" algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) and finds the best single region of similarity between two sequences. Other programs for determining identity and/or similarity between sequences are also known in the art, for instance the BLAST family of programs (Altschul S F et al; 1990, Altschul S F et al, 1997, accessible through the home page of the NCBI at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and FASTA (Pearson W R, 1990). \\nThe \"variant\" or \"mutein\" in accordance with the present invention include proteins having a sequence of amino acids sufficiently duplicative of that of FGF-18, such as to have substantially similar activity to FGF-18. In a preferred embodiment, any such variant or mutein has at least 40% identity or homology with the sequence of FGF-18. More preferably, it has at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or, most preferably, at least 90% identity or homology thereto. \\nMuteins of FGF-18, which can be used in accordance with the present invention, or nucleic acid coding thereof, include a finite set of substantially corresponding sequences as substitution peptides or polynucleotides which can be routinely obtained by one of ordinary skill in the art, without undue experimentation, based on the teachings and guidance presented herein. \\nPreferred changes for muteins in accordance with the present invention are what are known as \"conservative\" substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions of FGF-18 polypeptides may include synonymous amino acids within a group which have sufficiently similar physicochemical properties that substitution between members of the group will preserve the biological function of the molecule (Grantham, 1974). It is clear that insertions and deletions of amino acids may also be made in the above-defined sequences without altering their function, particularly if the insertions or deletions only involve a few amino acids, e.g., under thirty, and preferably under ten, and do not remove or displace amino acids which are critical to a functional conformation, e.g., cysteine residues. Proteins and muteins produced by such deletions and/or insertions come within the purview of the present invention. \\nPreferably, the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table A. More preferably, the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table B; and most preferably the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table C.\\n TABLE-tabl0001 TABLE A Preferred Groups of Synonymous Amino Acids Amino Acid Synonymous Group Ser Ser, Thr, Gly, Asn Arg Arg, Gin, Lys, Glu, His Leu Ile, Phe, Tyr, Met, Val, Leu Pro Gly, Ala, Thr, Pro Thr Pro, Ser, Ala, Gly, His, Gln, Thr Ala Gly, Thr, Pro, Ala Val Met, Tyr, Phe, Ile, Leu, Val Gly Ala, Thr, Pro, Ser, Gly Ile Met, Tyr, Phe, Val, Leu, Ile Phe Trp, Met, Tyr, Ile, Val, Leu, Phe Tyr Trp, Met, Phe, Ile, Val, Leu, Tyr Cys Ser, Thr, Cys His Glu, Lys, Gln, Thr, Arg, His Gln Glu, Lys, Asn, His, Thr, Arg, Gln Asn Gln, Asp, Ser, Asn Lys Glu, Gln, His, Arg, Lys Asp Glu, Asn, Asp Glu Asp, Lys, Asn, Gln, His, Arg, Glu Met Phe, Ile, Val, Leu, Met Trp Trp \\n TABLE-tabl0002 TABLE B More Preferred Groups of Synonymous Amino Acids Amino Acid Synonymous Group Ser Ser Arg His, Lys, Arg Leu Leu, Ile, Phe, Met Pro Ala, Pro Thr Thr Ala Pro, Ala Val Val, Met, Ile Gly Gly Ile Ile, Met, Phe, Val, Leu Phe Met, Tyr, Ile, Leu, Phe Tyr Phe, Tyr Cys Cys, Ser His His, Gln, Arg Gln Glu, Gln, His Asn Asp, Asn Lys Lys, Arg Asp Asp, Asn Glu Glu, Gln Met Met, Phe, Ile, Val, Leu Trp Trp \\n TABLE-tabl0003 TABLE C Most Preferred Groups of Synonymous Amino Acids Amino Acid Synonymous Group Ser Ser Arg Arg Leu Leu, Ile, Met Pro Pro Thr Thr Ala Ala Val Val Gly Gly Ile Ile, Met, Leu Phe Phe Tyr Tyr Cys Cys, Ser His His Gln Gln Asn Asn Lys Lys Asp Asp Glu Glu Met Met, Ile, Leu Trp Met Examples of production of amino acid substitutions in proteins which can be used for obtaining muteins of FGF-18 for use in the present invention include any known method steps, such as presented in  US patents 4,959,314 ,  4,588,585  and  4,737,462 to Mark et al ;  5,116,943 to Koths et al. ,  4,965,195 to Namen et al ;  4,879,111 to Chong et al ; and  5,017,691 to Lee et al ; and lysine substituted proteins presented in  US patent No. 4,904,584 (Shaw et al ). Formulation of an FGF18-compound and administration FGF-18 compounds may be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, i.e. together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or the like. The definition of \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" is meant to encompass any carrier, which does not interfere with effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient and that is not toxic to the host to which it is administered. For example, for parenteral administration, the active protein(s) may be formulated in a unit dosage form for injection in vehicles such as saline, dextrose solution, serum albumin and Ringer\\'s solution. Such formulations of FGF-18 compounds including at least one further pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or the like are herein also referred to as \"FGF-18 compositions\". FGF-18 compounds and compositions can be applied by direct injection into the synovial fluid of the joint or directly into the defect, either alone or complexed with a suitable carrier for extended release of protein (such as for example suitable excipients for slow-release formulations, such as e.g. cyclodextrin) or restricted local release (such as, for example, delivery through biocompatible sponges, similar bio-matrixes, encapsulated cells or the like). Formulations for intraarticular (IA) application will comply with most of the requirements that also apply to other injection formulations, i.e., they need to be sterile and compatible with the physiological conditions at the application site (e.g., knee joint, SF). The sterility of solution formulations can be achieved by autoclaving (if all components of the formulation are sufficiently resistant to thermal stress) or sterile filtration, while for other formulations, the manufacturing processes required for ensuring a sterile product may be more complex. For example, sterile filtration is not feasible for formulations containing particles (suspensions), semi-solid or solid formulations. For compatibility of the formulation with the physiological conditions at the site of injection, the characteristics of the SF have to be taken into consideration. Preferably formulations of the invention therefore are isotonic. The pH of the formulations is either close to the pH of SF (i.e., pH7.4) or slightly lower, but preferably not below pH -5.5, to allow for optimum stability of the active ingredient, while minimizing possible side effects of non-physiological pH values such as activation of proteolytic enzymes, e.g., cathepsins. The excipients used for IA injection may also be present in other injection formulations, e.g., for intramuscular or subcutaneous application. In an embodiment of the present invention, the mode of administration of the FGF-18 compound described herein is selected from the group consisting of: intra-auricular administration, peri-auricular administration, intra-nasal administration, peri-nasal administration, endosinusial administration, intra-costal administration, peri-costal administration, intra-thoracic administration, peri-thoracic administration, epidural administration, peri-vertebral administration, peri-synovial administration, intra-synovial administration, endosinusial administration, peri-articular administration and intra-articular administration. In a preferred embodiment, the FGF-18 compound described herein is administered peri-articularly (administration around a joint) or intrarticularly (administration within a joint). In an embodiment of the present invention, the periarticular or intraarticular administration is done around or in a joint selected from joint of the hip, knee, elbow, wrist, ankle, spine, feet, finger, toe, hand, shoulder, ribs, shoulder blades, thighs, shins, heels and along the bony points of the spine. In yet another preferred embodiment the periarticular or intraarticular administration is done around or in a the joint of the hip or the knee. Cartilage disorders The present invention relates to methods of treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of a cartilage disorder in a mammal. Preferably such cartilage disorder result from damages due to traumatic injury or chondropathy. It is understood that preferably humans are patients to be treated according to the present invention; however, it is understood that other mammals, including but not limited to dogs, horses and the like may be treated with methods according to the present invention. Examples of cartilage disorders that may be treated, prevented or ameliorated by the treatment described herein include but are not restricted to: arthritis, osteochondritis, costochondritis (such as Tietze\\'syndrome), osteomyelitis, polychondritis, relapsing polychondritis and Osteochondritis Dissecans. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is arthritis. Preferably, said disease is selected from the group consisting of: ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), gout, pseudogout, infectious arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, scleroderma, Sj√∂gren\\'s syndrome and Still\\'s disease. In a preferred embodiment, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteoarthritis. Arthritis, relates to a damage to articular structures (joints) in the body and related inflammatory processes. Arthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritic joints as a result of injury, and the like, are common inflammatory conditions which would benefit from the therapeutic use of FGF18 according to the present invention. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is arthritis involving the spine. It causes pain and stiffness in the back, and also a bent posture. This is a result of ongoing swelling and irritation of the spinal joints (vertebrae). In severe cases, inflammation of the vertebrae can eventually cause them to fuse together leading to severely limited mobility. Inflammation of the tendons and ligaments that connect and provide support to joints can lead to pain and tenderness in the ribs, shoulder blades, hips, thighs, shins, heels and along the bony points of the spine. \\nAnkylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory form of arthritis that affects the spinal joints. The hallmark feature of AS is the involvement of the joints at the base of the spine where the spine joins the pelvis - the sacroiliac (SI) joints. \\nThe disease course is highly variable, and while some individuals have episodes of transient back pain only, others have more chronic severe back pain that leads to differing degrees of spinal stiffness over time. In almost all cases the disease is characterized by acute painful episodes and remissions (periods where the problem settles). \\nOver the years AS has been known by many different names including poker back, rheumatoid spondylitis, and Marie-Strumpells spondylitis. Since the early 70s with increasing knowledge about the disease, there is almost universal use of the term ankylosing spondylitis. AS is a member of the family of diseases that attack the spine. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is characterized by excessive bone growth along the sides of the vertebrae of the spine. It also involves inflammation and bone growth where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, such as at the elbow, knee and the heel of the foot. Bone spurs are common among people with DISH. \\nDISH (sometimes called Forestier\\'s disease) is considered a form of degenerative arthritis and is characterized by excessive bone growth along the sides of the vertebrae of the spine. It is also associated with inflammation and calcification (bone growth) at other areas of the body where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, such as at the elbow, knee and the heel of the foot. These can lead to bone spurs. Heel spurs, for example, are common among people with DISH. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is gout. Gout is a type of arthritis in which uric acid, a waste product that occurs naturally occurring within the body, rises above normal levels. Rather than being flushed by the kidneys and through the urine, as it normally is, it forms crystals and deposits in the joints. These deposits give rise to inflammation of the joints, causing pain, swelling, redness and tenderness of the area. Most typically the joint affected is that of the big toe, but gout can also affect the ankle, knee, foot, hand, wrist and elbow. Uric acid crystals may also form deposits in other areas such as under the skin or in other soft tissues, and in the kidney or urinary tract. \\nGout typically affects the joint at the base of the big toe. In over half of all initial attacks, this is the first joint affected. Almost any other joint can be affected, but the joints of the lower limbs are more commonly than those of the upper limbs. \\nThe majority of initial gout attacks involve only one joint, and, with treatment, subside within three to ten days. Over 50% of people who have had an acute attack of gout will have a recurrence within the year. Over time the attacks may become more frequent, longer lasting and often involve more joints. \\nFor some people the attacks linger, and the disease becomes chronic. The crystals of uric acid deposited inside the joint and in the surrounding soft tissues lead to destructive changes in the joint and cause persistent inflammation. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is pseudogout. Pseudogout is a type of arthritis that is caused by the build up of calcium in the body. Pseudogout results from a build up of calcium crystals (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) in a joint. The calcium forms crystals that deposit in the joints between bones. This causes swelling and pain in the area. The calcium deposits and chronic inflammation can cause parts of the joint structure to weaken and break down. \\nWith pseudogout cartilage can begin to crack and get holes in it and cause more pain and swelling in the joint. Over time the cartilage may wear away entirely, and the bones rub together. \\nMuch of the pain of pseudogout is a result of muscles and the other tissues that help joints move (such as tendons and ligaments) being forced to work in ways for which they were not designed, as a result of damage to the cartilage. Cartilage itself does not have nerve cells, and therefore cannot sense pain, but the muscles, tendons, ligaments and bones do. After many years of cartilage erosion, bones may actually rub together. This grinding of bone against bone adds further to the pain. Bones can also thicken and form growths, called spurs or osteophytes, which rub together. \\nLike the disease gout, pseudogout can come on as sudden, recurrent attacks of pain and swelling in a single joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is infectious arthritis. Infectious arthritis causes pain and swelling in the joints. The inflammation is caused by a germ. The germ can be a bacterium , a virus, or a fungus. There is usually only one joint involved, though sometimes two or three joints can become infected. It does not usually last a long time if it is treated early. \\nMostly, infectious arthritis affects the large joints (shoulders, hips, knees), but smaller joints (fingers, ankles) can also be involved. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It may be caused by the breakdown of cartilage. Bits of cartilage may break off and cause pain and swelling in the joint between bones. Over time the cartilage may wear away entirely, and the bones will rub together. \\nOsteoarthritis can affect any joint but usually concerns hands and weight-bearing joints such as hips, knees, feet, and spine. \\nThe disease state of osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex, multi-factorial progressive disease that is non-inflammatory in nature and which is characterized by a general age-related degradation of articular cartilage in the joints. OA is also characterized by chondrocyte activation leading to cell proliferation and apoptosis, protease expression and abnormal matrix production, failed cartilage repair leading to loss of extracellular matrix, matrix calcification and osteophyte formation. The degradation of cartilage and extracellular matrix structures leads to increased friction between the bones and nerves of the affected joints. OA causes varying levels of pain and progressive debilitation in those afflicted with the disease. Current therapies for OA are palliative or surgical. \\nIn healthy joints cartilage acts as a shock absorber when weight is put on the joint. The slippery surface of the cartilage allows the bones to move smoothly. When a joint develops osteoarthritis the cartilage gradually becomes rough and thin, and the bone underneath thickens. \\nAlthough there is usually no swelling in the early stage of the disease, as the arthritis progresses there can be inflammation. Bits of cartilage may break off and float around inside the joint. This disturbs other soft tissues inside the joint and can cause pain and swelling between bones. \\nOver time as the cartilage wears down, the bones may form bumps on their ends. These bumps are called spurs. Or, the cartilage may wear away entirely, and bones may directly come in contact with each other. \\nOA may lead to other problems such as: the muscles that hold the joint in place weaken because they are not being used, over time the joint looses its shape and does not work at all. \\nOA commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as hips, knees, feet and spine. However, non-weight bearing joints such as finger joints and the joint at the base of the thumb may be affected as well. It usually does not affect other joints, except when they have been injured or been put under unusual stress. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease that mainly involves the synovial membrane of multiple joints with resultant injury to the articular cartilage. The pathogenesis is T lymphocyte dependent and is associated with the production of rheumatoid factors, auto-antibodies directed against self IgG, with the resultant formation of immune complexes that attain high levels in joint fluid and blood. These complexes in the joint may induce the marked infiltrate of lymphocytes and monocytes into the synovium and subsequent marked synovial changes; the joint space/fluid is infiltrated by similar cells with the addition of numerous neutrophils. Tissues affected are primarily the joints, often in symmetrical pattern. Inflammatory cells release enzymes that may digest bone and cartilage. As a result of rheumatoid arthritis, the inflamed joint lining, the synovium, can invade and damage bone and cartilage leading to joint deterioration and severe pain amongst other physiologic effects. The involved joint can lose its shape and alignment, resulting in pain and loss of movement. Therefore RA may lead to severe disability and increased mortality. \\nJoint damage can occur even in cases where the pain is not severe. It can happen even in the early stages of the disease. For many people with RA, damage has shown up on X-rays of the hands and feet within two years of the onset of the disease. But it may be too late to treat by the time X-rays discover the problem. \\nSevere damage can lead to permanent joint deformity and disability. Pain and swelling may cause difficulty walking. A variety of cytokines are produced locally in the rheumatoid joints. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 and TNF-alpha, two prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokines, play an important role in the mechanisms involved in synovial inflammation and in progressive joint destruction. Indeed, the administration of TNF-alpha and IL-1 inhibitors in patients with RA has led to a dramatic improvement of clinical and biological signs of inflammation and a reduction of radiological signs of bone erosion and cartilage destruction. However, despite these encouraging results, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to these agents, suggesting that other mediators are also involved in the pathophysiology of arthritis. One important way to distinguish RA from other forms of arthritis is by the pattern of joint involvement. For example, RA affects the wrist and many of the hand joints but usually not the joints that are most distal joints. In RA, the joints tend to be involved in a symmetrical pattern. That is, if the knuckles on the right hand are inflamed, the knuckles on the left hand are likely to be inflamed as well. Other joints commonly affected by RA include the elbows, shoulders, neck, jaw, feet, ankles, knees, and hips. Other than the neck, the spine usually is not directly affected by RA. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a condition that causes swelling and pain in and around the joints. It also causes a scaly rash on the skin. \\nIt can affect a number of joints including the fingers, wrists, toes, knees, ankles, elbows and shoulder joints, the spine and joints in the lower back (called sacroiliac joints). Psoriatic arthritis also affects tissues surrounding the joints including tendons and ligaments. It may cause swelling of a whole digit called \"sausage\" finger or toe. There is also skin inflammation, particularly on the elbows, knees and scalp. Psoriatic arthritis is linked to psoriasis, a disorder causing areas of the skin to become inflamed and be covered with silvery or grey scales. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis refers to pain, stiffness, redness or swelling in a joint resulting from a previous infection. It most often occurs in the joints of the lower limbs (knees, ankles, toes), but can also occur in the upper limbs. Problems may be in the joints only or involve other body systems such as the eyes, skin muscles or tendons. When it affects areas besides the joints, reactive arthritis is then called Reiter\\'s syndrome. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is scleroderma. Scleroderma is a condition where the skin gets thick and hard. There are two main types of scleroderma. One type is localized scleroderma, which affects mainly the skin. It can also involve the muscles and joints. The other type, generalized scleroderma, affects the skin as well as the internal organs, such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. \\nThe most characteristic feature of scleroderma is the build-up of tough scar-like fibrous tissue in the skin. Less visible changes include damage to the cells lining the walls of small blood vessels. This may in turn damage major organs. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Sj√∂gren\\'s syndrome. Sj√∂gren\\'s syndrome is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the salivary glands resulting in dry mouth, and the tear glands, resulting in dry eyes. It can also affect other parts of the body including joints, muscles and nerves, organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, stomach and brain, or glands such as the thyroid gland. Sj√∂gren\\'s syndrome can cause complete destruction of any of these areas. Since Sj√∂gren\\'s syndrome can affect the liver and pancreas, there is a greater chance of developing cancer of the lymph tissue. However, this is an unusual and rare result. Sj√∂gren\\'s syndrome can occur in two ways. It is \\'secondary\\' Sj√∂gren\\'s syndrome when it occurs in people who have a rheumatic condition or connective tissue disease such as lupus, scleroderma or polymyositis. It is named \\'primary\\' Sj√∂gren\\'s syndrome when dry eyes and mouth are not associated with a rheumatic condition. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Still\\'s disease. Still\\'s disease is a form of arthritis characterized by high spiking fevers, salmon-coloured rashes and inflammation of the joints. The disease is most common among children, for whom it is commonly referred to as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. \\nStill\\'s disease can also occur among adults, although much less commonly than for children. In this case it is referred to as adult-onset Still\\'s disease or AOSD. As disclosed here above, cartilage disorders that may be treated, prevented or ameliorated by the treatment described herein include: Osteochondritis Dissecans, costochondritis (such as Tietze\\'syndrome), osteomyelitis, and relapsing polychondritis. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Osteochondritis Dissecans. Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a term for osteochondral fracture. An osteochondral fragment may be present  in situ,  incompletely detached, or completely detached. OCD is a form of osteochondrosis limited to the articular epiphysis. Articular epiphyses fail as a result of compression. Both trauma and ischemia probably are involved in the pathology. Trauma is most likely the primary insult, with ischemia as secondary injury. \\nTrauma may be caused by direct trauma, such as impaction fracture, or repetitive microtrauma, such as excessive normal compressive stress. \\nThe knee joint is the most commonly involved site. However, the elbow joint, the ankle joint, tarsal navicular, hip joint, shoulder joint, Glenoid, wrist joint may also be affected. \\nOCD tends to affect young patients. In OCD of the elbow, patient age averages 23 years and ranges from 4-47 years. In the ankle, patient age averages 20 years and ranges from 8-50 years. In the hip, patient age averages 24 years and ranges from 14-39 years. \\nPatients usually report pain at the extremes of motion range. Periarticular edema often is present with slight warmth to the touch. When a lower extremity is involved, patients often limp. Symptoms usually improve with protected immobilization of the joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is costochondritis. Costochondritis is an inflammation of the junctions where the upper ribs join with the cartilage that holds them to the breastbone or sternum. The cause is usually unknown. When the pain of costochondritis is accompanied by swelling it is referred to as Tietze\\'s syndrome. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory process of the bone and its structures secondary to infection with pyogenic organisms. \\nThe infection associated with osteomyelitis may be localized or it may spread through the periosteum, cortex, marrow, and cancellous tissue. The bacterial pathogen varies on the basis of the patient\\'s age and the mechanism of infection. \\nHematogenous osteomyelitis is an infection caused by bacterial seeding from the blood. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is characterized by an acute infection of the bone caused by the seeding of the bacteria within the bone from a remote source. This condition occurs primarily in children. The most common site is the rapidly growing and highly vascular metaphysis of growing bones. The apparent slowing or sludging of blood flow as the vessels make sharp angles at the distal metaphysis predisposes the vessels to thrombosis and the bone itself to localized necrosis and bacterial seeding. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, despite its name, may have a slow clinical development and insidious onset. \\nDirect or contiguous inoculation osteomyelitis is caused by direct contact of the tissue and bacteria during trauma or surgery. Direct inoculation (contiguous-focus) osteomyelitis is an infection in the bone secondary to the inoculation of organisms from direct trauma, spread from a contiguous focus of infection, or sepsis after a surgical procedure. Clinical manifestations of direct inoculation osteomyelitis are more localized than those of hematogenous osteomyelitis and tend to involve multiple organisms. \\nAdditional categories include chronic osteomyelitis and osteomyelitis secondary to peripheral vascular disease. Chronic osteomyelitis persists or recurs, regardless of its initial cause and/or mechanism and despite aggressive intervention. Although listed as an etiology, peripheral vascular disease is actually a predisposing factor rather than a true cause of infection. \\nDisease states known to predispose patients to osteomyelitis include diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), IV drug abuse, alcoholism, chronic steroid use, immunosuppression, and chronic joint disease. In addition the presence of a prosthetic orthopedic device is an independent risk factor as is any recent orthopedic surgery or open fracture. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is relapsing polychondritis. Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an uncommon and severe episodic inflammatory condition involving cartilaginous structures, predominantly those of the ear, nose, and laryngotracheobronchial tree. Other affected structures may include the eye, cardiovascular system, peripheral joints, middle ear, and inner ear. \\nThe etiology of this disease is unknown; however, the pathogenesis is most likely autoimmune in nature. Evidence for an autoimmune etiology includes its clinical association with other autoimmune disorders, its association with the HLA-DR4 haplotype, pathology findings of infiltrating CD4 T cells and antigen-antibody complexes in the affected cartilage, cellular and humoral responses against collagen type II and other collagen antigens, and the observation that immunosuppressive regimens most often suppress the disease. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is cartilage damage resulting from a trauma. Cartilage injuries can occur as a result of traumatic mechanical destruction. A direct blow or other trauma can injure the cartilage. Cartilage has no direct blood supply, thus it has little capacity to repair itself. The methods of the present invention improve cartilage repair. Therefore in an embodiment of the present invention, cartilage damage resulting from a trauma is resulting from an accident or from surgery. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, cartilage damage resulting from a trauma is resulting from surgery, in particular orthopedic surgery or plastic surgery. Also considered by the present invention is the treatment of sport-related injury or sport-related wear of tissues of the joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is an unaesthetic appearance disorder. In such an embodiment, the method and use of the present invention may be used in association to plastic surgery.

EXAMPLE 1: Disease models in animals and extended pharmacology In vivo,  FGF-18(170AA) was tested in different disease models of OA and damaged cartilage, with significant therapeutic efficacy using an intra-articular (i.a.) dosing. Overall a therapeutically effective dose of 3-40 ¬µg i.a. per animal/week was demonstrable in different species (rat, dog). Results from the aforementioned animal models of disease (OA as well as cartilage defects) are summarized below.\\n TABLE-tabl0004 Table 1: Summary of pharmacology studies with FGF-18(170AA) Animal Disease model Dosage (¬µg/injection) Route/Administration Results Rat Injury-induced OA 0.1, 1, 5 (formulated in hyaluronan) Twice weekly i.a. injections for 3 weeks ‚Ä¢ Reduced cartilage degeneration ‚Ä¢ Reduced depth of cartilage lesions in a dose-dependent manner.

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)  a 0, 3, 10, 30 i.a. once weekly see example 1.3. a  Discussed in more detail below EXAMPLE 1.1: Rat meniscal tear model of OA Method Male Lewis rats (5-10/group) underwent surgery to induce a medial meniscal tear in the right knee joint. Dosing by the i.a. route was initiated 19-21 days after surgery at doses of 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 ¬µg (formulated in saline) to determine pharmacodynamic effects related to the dosing regimen. These total doses were administered either as (i) single dose, (ii) once weekly (1/3 of total dose per injection) for 3 weeks, or (iii) three times weekly for 3 weeks (1/9 of total dose per injection). \\nAt the conclusion of treatment or after 3 weeks post-treatment, right knees were collected for histopathology evaluation of potential effects. Evaluation of the lesions was performed in 3 different zones: regional differences across the medial tibial plateau were taken into consideration by dividing each section into 3 zones (1-outside, 2-middle, 3-inside). In the surgical OA model, the outside (z1) and middle (z2) thirds are usually most severely affected, and milder changes are present on the inside third (z3).\\n Experimental Design Animals (5-10/group), housed 2-3/cage, are anesthetized with Isoflurane and the right knee area is prepared for surgery. A skin incision is made over the medial aspect of the knee and the medial collateral ligament is exposed by blunt dissection, and then transected. The medial meniscus is cut through the full thickness to simulate a complete tear. Skin and subcutis are closed with 4-0 Vicryl suture using a subcuticular pattern. Dosing by the intra-articular route is initiated 19-21 days after surgery and is discontinued after a single dose or continued for 3 weeks with intra-articular injections once per week or 3 times per week. Rats are then terminated (g1-16) or allowed to recover for an additional 3 weeks prior to termination (g17-32).Four hours prior to necropsy, all rats are given 50 mg/kg BRDU to label actively proliferating cells. Blood is collected for serum just prior to necropsy and synovial lavage is done on the right knee. At necropsy, the right (operated) knee joint was trimmed of muscle and connective tissue and collected into 10% neutral buffered formalin. The patella is removed to allow proper fixation of the joints. Trachea, sternum, and ear samples are also placed in formalin. Results evaluated at 6 weeks post surgery Untreated controls (evaluated at  6  weeks post surgery) Untreated animals with medial meniscal tear that were terminated at 6 weeks post surgery had tibial cartilage degeneration which was most severe on the outer 2/3 of the tibial plateau and less severe on the inside 1/3. Osteophytes were large (mean 468 ¬µm). Femoral cartilage degeneration was milder and more variable than tibial degeneration. Animals treated with saline once weekly had a significantly lower zone 3 total of tibial cartilage degeneration scores (16%), a significantly lower depth ratio (16%), and a significantly greater area of viable cartilage in the lateral tibia as compared to untreated animals (13%). Animals treated with saline 3 times weekly had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores in zone 2 of the tibia (24%), a significantly lower depth ratio (13%), and significantly greater area of viable cartilage in both the medial and lateral tibia (15 and 14%). These differences in the control groups are likely a result of repeated anesthesia events influencing overall activity of the animals, although the possibility that repeated saline injections influenced lesion severity by facilitating removal of mediators and debris cannot be ruled out. Single dose treatment (evaluated at 6 weeks post surgery) Animals given a single dose of 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) had a significantly greater width of total cartilage degeneration (16%) due to an increase in proteoglycan loss in zone 3. Osteophyte scores and measurements were significantly increased (19 and 25%, respectively) in animals given a single dose of 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage matrix in the medial tibia was significantly increased by 27% in animals treated with 10 ¬µg. Immunostaining revealed bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) immunopositivity in fibrotic marrow subjacent to cartilage lesions and in bone marrow cells, fibroblasts, and osteophyte cartilage, with similar staining patterns in saline and FGF-18(170AA) treated joints. These results indicate that a single injection of 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) had a definite anabolic effect, as evidenced by increased osteophyte size and increased medial tibial cartilage area. These changes were not, however, sufficient to improve the overall cartilage degeneration scores. It is likely that the increase in medial cartilage area is a result of increased cartilage thickness on the load bearing surface adjacent to the osteophyte. Once weekly for 3 weeks (evaluated at  6  weeks post surgery) Animals treated with 3 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) once weekly had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores compared to the saline once weekly control in zone 2 of the medial tibia. Animals given 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) had significantly lower significant degeneration width (37%), and those given 3 ¬µg (28%) or 1 ¬µg (15%) also had some inhibition. Osteophyte scores and measurements were dose responsively and significantly increased by treatment with 10 (32 and 53%) or 3 (21 and 32%) ¬µg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage matrix in the medial tibia was significantly increased by treatment with 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) (27%). Mild to marked chronic active synovitis with fibrosis was evident in joints injected with 10 or 3 ¬µg and those injected with 1 ¬µg had minimal synovitis. Subchondral bone resorption was minimally increased in a few joints treated with 10 ¬µg. Animals treated with 3 or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) had increased BRDU labeling in the fibrotic marrow, synovium, and in areas of chondrogenesis or osteophytes, as compared to saline controls. These results demonstrated dose responsive benefit of treatment using the once weekly paradigm on the significant cartilage degeneration width. This parameter is most indicative of the presence of a viable matrix of some type within the defect area and, along with medial tibial cartilage areas, demonstrates the anabolic response. The BRDU labeling results indicate continued proliferative responses after cessation of dosing. Three times weekly for  3  weeks (evaluated at 6 weeks post surgery) Treatment with 1, 3 or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) administered as 3 injections per week resulted in a significant decrease in tibial cartilage degeneration scores compared to the 3 times weekly saline control in zone 1 (animals treated with 10 ¬µg), zone 2 (1or 3 ¬µg), and the zone 3 total (1 or 3 ¬µg). Treatment with 10 ¬µg significantly increased the total tibial cartilage degeneration width by 24%. Treatment with 1 or 3 ¬µg nonsignificantly decreased cartilage degeneration width by 24% and 21% respectively, indicating some beneficial effect. Animals treated with 1 or 3 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) also had significantly lower depth ratios (17% and 18% respectively) than saline controls. The medial tibial osteophyte score was increased after treatment with 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) (13%, 7%, 13% and 15% respectively), while all 4 doses (0.3, 1, 3 or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA)) significantly increased the osteophyte measurement (12, 18, 60 and 62 %, respectively. Treatment with 10 ¬µg significantly increased the femoral cartilage degeneration score by 114%. Bone scores were significantly increased by treatment with 3 (60%) or 10 (88%) ¬µg FGF-18(170AA). The total joint score without femur was significantly decreased by treatment with 3 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) (13%), but the addition of the femur to the total joint score eliminated that variation. Treatment with 1, 3 or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased the area of viable cartilage in the medial tibia (13%, 29% and 29%), and treatment with 3 or 10 ¬µg significantly increased area in the lateral tibia (22% and 13%). Joints injected with 3 or 10 ¬µg had marked to severe synovitis with increased subchondral bone resorption and similar but mild to moderate changes were observed in joints treated with 1 ¬µg. Animals treated with 1, 30 or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) had BRDU labeling in numerous areas including marrow, osteophytes, meniscus, synovium, and areas of chondrogenesis. These results demonstrated the most pronounced anabolic effects of any treatment paradigm, but were accompanied by severe synovial inflammation and increased subchondral bone resorption. Results evaluated at 9 weeks post surgery Untreated controls (evaluated at 9 weeks post surgery) Untreated animals with medial meniscal tear that were terminated at 9 weeks had tibial cartilage degeneration which was most severe on the outer 2/3 of the tibial plateau and less severe on the inside 1/3. Femoral cartilage degeneration was less severe and more variable. Scores were, in general, higher than in untreated animals terminated at week 6. Single dose saline controls had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores in zone 2 of the tibia (12%) than those of the once weekly saline controls (18%). Single dose saline controls also had significantly greater width of moderate collagen degeneration (92%). Animals given saline once weekly had a significantly lower sum of severe, marked, moderate, and mild collagen degeneration (15%), as those of the 3 times weekly saline control animals (22%). These differences were relatively minor since there were only 5 rats in each of these groups and were a result of variation in disease progression in individuals. Single dose (evaluated at  9  weeks post surgery, incl. 3 weeks post-treatment) There was no significant effect of treatment in any animals given a single dose of FGF-18(170AA) and terminated 9 weeks after surgery, although a few joints injected with 10 ¬µg had evidence of anabolic response on the lateral tibia. Once weekly for 3 weeks (evaluated at 9 weeks post surgery, incl. 3 weeks post-treatment) After treatment with 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) once weekly, significant decreases in cartilage degeneration scores in zone 1 and zone 3 total of the medial tibia by 38 and 31% were observed. Treatment with 0.3 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) significantly reduced scores in zone 2 compared to the once weekly saline control. Animals treated with 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) had significantly lower significant cartilage degeneration width (38%). Depth ratios were significantly decreased by treatment with 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) (22%). Treatment with 3 or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) significantly and identically increased osteophyte scores (25%), but only animals given 10 ¬µg had significantly increased osteophyte measurements (53%). There was a 23% significant decrease in total joint score with femur in animals given 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage was significantly increased in animals given 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) in both the medial (40%) and lateral (81%) tibia. Treatment with 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) significantly reduced the width of severe and minimal collagen degeneration, as well as the width of severe, marked, and moderated degeneration combined and the width of severe and marked combined. Synovial inflammation was minimal in joints injected with 3 or 10 ¬µg and absent at lower doses. Anabolic responses were evident in some or all joints injected with any dose. BRDU labeling was seen mainly in bone marrow and fibroblasts of saline controls and increased labeling (cartilage and osteophytes) was seen in joints injected with 10 ¬µg. These results indicated that the cartilage repair/anabolic responses continued beyond the treatment period and that synovitis subsided, although osteophyte measures were comparable at 6 or 9 weeks in joints treated with this dose. Dose responsive benefit was seen using the significant cartilage degeneration parameter and severe matrix loss, as measured by collagen degeneration, was improved. Three times weekly for 3 weeks (evaluated at  9  weeks post surgery, incl.  3  weeks post-treatment) The zone 3 total tibial cartilage degeneration score was significantly decreased by 38% in animals given 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) as 3 injections weekly, as compared to the 3 times weekly saline control. Treatment with 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) also significantly decreased the significant cartilage degeneration width (48%). The depth ratio was significantly decreased by 27% in animals treated with 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA). Osteophyte measurements were significantly increased in animals treated with 3 (57%) or 10 (103%) ¬µg FGF-18(170AA). Treatment with 1, 3, or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased the area of viable cartilage in the medial tibia (34%, 37% and 71% respectively), while treatment with 0.3 or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased areas in the lateral tibia (46% and 67%). Mild collagen degeneration width was significantly increased in animals treated with 3 or 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA), as was the width of mild and minimal degeneration combined in animals given 10 ¬µg. Mild synovitis was present in all joints injected with 10 ¬µg (divided) and minimal to mild synovitis was present in those given 1 or 3 ¬µg. Anabolic responses were evident from 1 ¬µg upwards. BRDU labeling was seen mainly in bone marrow and fibroblasts of saline controls and increased labeling (cartilage and osteophytes) was seen in joints injected with 10 ¬µg. These results indicated that the cartilage repair/anabolic responses continued beyond the treatment period and that synovitis subsided as compared to the 6 week time point. Beneficial effects on collagen loss were less clear, although there was a definite trend towards smaller measurements for the areas of marked to severe loss. EXAMPLE 1.2: Dog menisectomy model of OA Female beagle dogs (n=3/group) that had had unilateral partial medial menisectomy on the left knee one month prior to initiation of treatment were treated with saline or 3, 10, or 30 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) once, once weekly, or three times weekly (divided 1/3 doses) for 3 weeks to determine beneficial effects on established OA. After 3 weeks of treatment, left knees were evaluated for effects on gross (n=3/group) and microscopic (n=3/group) changes induced by menisectomy and for evidence of anabolic effects. All dogs except one exhibited normal appetite and activity throughout the study. One dog (YLI-8) from group 12 died prior to termination (day 17) due to aspiration pneumonia associated with repeated anesthesia for joint injections. Typical degenerative changes characterized by the presence of focal, well circumscribed lesions of cartilage degeneration were present on the medial tibias of all operated dogs in all groups. Femoral lesions were sporadically observed. \\nAll dogs had minimal medial joint capsule thickening. Meniscal damage (approximately 1/2 absent at necropsy with generally none to moderate repair) was similar in all groups. \\nMicroscopic evaluation revealed that untreated and vehicle treated knees often had cartilage hypertrophy with cloning in the zone 1 of levels 1 and 2. Definite anabolic effects (increased cloning, cellularity, and proteoglycan staining in lesion areas) were observed in knees treated with 30 ¬µg (10 ¬µg three times weekly) FGF-18(170AA), and these changes were most identifiable on femoral condyles. Lesser, but still convincing anabolic effects were observed in some knees treated 3 times weekly with the lower doses of FGF-18(170AA), or in knees treated with 30 or 10 ¬µg once weekly. When present, these FGF-18(170AA) induced changes were generally in the upper 1/3 to 1/2 of the cartilage or in matrix adjacent to deeper clefts. \\nResults of this study demonstrated definite anabolic effects of i.a. treatment with 10 ¬µg FGF-18(170AA) 3 times weekly (30 ¬µg total/week) in all knees and lesser effects in some knees treated with lower doses 3 times weekly or with 30 or 10 ¬µg once weekly. The changes consisted of cloning, increased proteoglycan synthesis in the upper 1/3 to 1/2 of the cartilage or in matrix adjacent to clefts. Mild marginal zone proliferative changes were observed in some joints but there were no excessive changes similar to those occurring in rats. The anabolic changes in articular cartilage were greater than the anabolic changes in marginal zones in all cases. Collagen damage measurements also suggested some protection of matrix integrity. EXAMPLE 1.3: Dog anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) model For investigations on severe progressive osteoarthritis, the dog anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) model is used for pre-clinical pharmacology investigations, including MRI evaluation at end of treatment and at follow up. This model provides efficacy data (histopathological and MRI over time and follow up) together with data on function by means of gait analysis. Using a non-invasive read-out MRI already at end of treatment a decrease in cartilage lesions compared to healthy baseline was demonstrable (-13.3, -7.5, -9.3 and -8.8 for vehicle, 3 ¬µg/joint, 10 ¬µg/joint and 30 ¬µg/joint, respectively). Also a functional improvement measured via gait analysis on force plate is demonstrable at end of therapy: \\nGait analysis was performed using a platform-based pressure/force measurement (Matscan¬Æ System, Tekscan Inc, Boston, MA, USA). Gait acquisition procedures The Matscan¬Æ System comprises 4 walkway floor displays, each having 2,288 sensing elements included in a sensing area of 432 mm X 368 mm, producing a spatial resolution of 1.4 sensels/cm2. This device was calibrated with a predefined weight at the beginning of the study and the same calibration was used for all dogs throughout the study. For the osteoarthritis-induced hind limb, the peak vertical force and the contact area were acquired at a trotting gait velocity ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 meters/second. Velocity was ensured using a chronometer. The gait acquisition window was 3 seconds with a sampling rate set at 44 hertz, producing a total of 132 frames. The first 5 valid trials were obtained for each dog and then averaged to characterize the dog profile at a given point in time. The peak vertical force was expressed in percentage of body weight (%BW) and the contact area was expressed in square centimeters (cm2). With regard to the peak vertical force of the osteoarthritis-induced hind limb acquired at the trot, the canine osteoarthritis model produced an abnormal gait (week 4) discernable over preoperative values (baseline). The peak vertical force and the contact area were decreased 4 and 8 weeks following surgery as negative changes were observed in all groups (Tables 3 & 4). There was however a trend for dogs in Group IV at 8 weeks following surgery to have a less severe decrease compared to baseline vis-√†-vis the other groups.\\n TABLE-tabl0006 TABLE 3 Peak Vertical Force  Acquired At The Trot (Dynamic Event) For The Osteoarthritis-Induced Hind Limb Group Animals (n) Peak vertical force A  Week 4 (% BW ) b Week 8 (% BW ) b I \\nOA: placebo control 8 -37.34 ¬± 5.68 -27.45 ¬± 3.90 II \\nFGF-18: 3 ¬µg/joint 8 -34.84 ¬± 3.65 -22.08 ¬± 2.87 III \\nFGF-18: 10 ¬µg/joint 8 -36.59 ¬± 3.14 -25.11 ¬± 3.03 IV \\nFGF-18: 30 ¬µg/joint 8 -32.28 ¬± 3.05 -15.71 ¬± 1.85 a.

The results of  in vitro  pharmacology demonstrated specific activity on chondrocytes (proliferation and cartilage regeneration/collagen synthesis) and the absence of adverse effects like leukocyte proliferation or cytokine release by different cell types after exposure to FGF-18(170AA).

A comparable value was obtained taking into account the whole articulation without synovial fluid (16 hours). Overall, the results indicated that the total radioactivity distributed outside the synovial fluid into the tissues of the knee articulation. The results obtained after autoradioluminography analysis of the treated knee joints shown that most of the radioactivity was localized in close proximity to the articulation. The results of whole body autoradioluminography analyses after intravenous administration and intra-articular administration of [ 3 H]-FGF18 are reported in table 8 and in table 9, respectively.

The measured half live in serum was about 55 hours. After intra-articular administration the means of total radioactivity increased slowly reaching the highest concentration at 24 and 48 hours after administration, in serum and blood, respectively. The systemic exposure was approximately 20% of that found after intravenous administration. Total radioactivity in serum was on average higher than that in blood, suggesting that the parent compound and/or its metabolites had low affinity for blood cells and circulating radioactivity was mainly distributed in serum. The levels of total radioactivity in the treated articulation declined bi-phasically with a terminal half-life of 20 hours. Overall, the results indicated that the total radioactivity distributed outside the synovial fluid into the knee articulation. Overall, based on the non-clinical pharmacology models in rat and dog, it is found that a particularly appropriate dosing regimen is once weekly for three weeks. The effective dose observed varies from 3-30 ¬µg/joint.

More specifically, it relates to the use of FGF-18 in treatment regimens and for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of patients having a cartilage disorder such as osteoarthritis, such as for example knee osteoarthritis or secondary hip osteoarthritis. Specifically provided is a preferred treatment scheme comprising once weekly administration of an FGF-18 compound per treatment cycle. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FGF18 was identified as a member of the FGF family which was most closely related to FGF8 and FGF17. Activities associated with FGF18 include stimulation of mesenchymal lineage cells, in particular cardiac myocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes (U.S. Patent No. 6,352,971 ). FGF18 binds and activates FGFR4 and the INc splice variant of FGFR3 and FGFR2. Bone remodeling is the dynamic process by which tissue mass and skeletal architecture are maintained. The process is a balance between bone resorption and bone formation, with two cell types thought to be the major players. These cells are the osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts synthesize and deposit matrix to become new bone. The activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are regulated by many factors, systemic and local, including growth factors. Cartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. It is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are dispersed in a firm, gel-like ground substance, called the matrix. Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, in the throat and between intervertebral disks. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. The main purpose of cartilage is to provide a framework upon which bone deposition could begin. Another important purpose of cartilage is to provide smooth surfaces and mechanical protection for the movement of articulating bones. Replacement of damaged cartilage, in particular articular cartilage, caused either by injury or disease is a major challenge for physicians, and available treatments are considered unpredictable and effective for only a limited time. Virtually all currently available treatments for cartilage damage focus on pain relief, with little or no efficacy on regeneration of damaged tissues. Therefore, the majority of younger patients either do not seek treatment or are counseled to postpone treatment for as long as possible. When treatment is required, the standard procedure is total joint replacement or microfracture, a procedure that involves penetration of the subchondral bone to stimulate fibrocartilage deposition by chondrocytes. For patients with osteoarthritis, non-surgical treatment consists of physical therapy, lifestyle modification (e.g. reducing activity), bracing, supportive devices, oral and injection drugs (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and medical management. Surgical options are very specific to osteoarthritis severity and can provide a reduction in symptoms that are generally only short lived. Tibial or femoral osteotomies (cutting the bone to rebalance joint wear) may reduce symptoms, help to maintain an active lifestyle, and delay the need for total joint replacement. Total joint replacement can provide relief for the symptom of advanced osteoarthritis, but generally requires a change in a patient\\'s lifestyle and/or activity level. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method for treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of cartilage disorders that would permit regeneration of damaged tissue. In addition, it would be desirable that such method be as safe and effective as possible. Moreover, as cartilage disorders may be chronic diseases, it would be desirable that such method permits re-treatments of the patient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for treating a patient having a cartilage disorder comprising the administration of an FGF-18 compound wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the cartilage disorder to be treated is osteoarthritis, the FGF-18 compound is the FGF-18 fragment designated herein as FGF-18(170AA) and the posology cycle is 10 to 30 meg per intra-articular injection once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (one treatment cycle). In a preferred embodiment such treatment cycles may be repeated after 4 or 6 months. For example, where a treatment cycle is repeated after 6 months, if a first treatment cycle is started e.g. in January of a given year, then a second treatment cycle may be started in July of said year. Further provided herein is the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. Also provided herein is the use of an FGF-18 compound for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. Provided herein is also the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder, the medicament being adapted to be administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides suitable treatment modalities, including suitable administration schemes for the treatment of various cartilage disorders, such as in particular osteoarthritis, with FGF-18 compounds, such as for example the FGF-18(170AA) protein fragment. In the context of the present invention it has been surprisingly found that FGF-18 compounds have optimal disease- or symptom-ameliorating effects on cartilage disorders when administered according to the methods and uses disclosed herein. It has been found that less frequent dosing schedules than contemplated by the present invention may not be fully effective, whereas more frequent dosing than contemplated by the present invention may cause inflammation and/or other counterproductive effects on the cartilage or joint environment when the same or comparable dosages as those contemplated by the present invention are being used. Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for treating a patient having a cartilage disorder comprising the administration of an FGF-18 compound wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. For example, where administrations are separated by about 4 days, a second administration may be made about 96 hours after a first administration; e.g. where and administration is given on day 1 in, for example, the morning, there will be 3 calendar days where the patient will not receive an administration (day 2, day 3, day 4) and the patient will again receive an administration on day 5 in the morning. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by about 7 days. In another aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by about 7 days. In a preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about 7 days each. Preferably, the FGF-18 compound is administered in regular intervals once per week. In an embodiment of the present invention there is provided the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder the medicament being adapted to be administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by about 7 days.

In a preferred embodiment the treatment comprises administration at a dose of 80, 90, 100, 110 or 120 mcg/kg per single intravenous administration of the FGF-18 compound. In a preferred embodiment the cartilage disorder treated by any of the methods of the invention is osteoarthritis, such as for example osteoarthritis which is classified as stage Il or stage III according to OARSI. In a preferred example the osteoarthritis may be knee osteoarthritis or hip osteoarthritis, such as secondary hip osteoarthritis. The skilled person is fully aware of osteoarthritis classifications that are used in the art. In particular, the OARSI classification is known in the art. The skilled person may reference the \"Guidelines for the medical management of osteoarthritis\" (Marc C. Hochberg, Roy D. Altman, Kenneth D. Brandt, Bruce M. Clark, Paul A. Dieppe, Marie R. Griffin, Roland W. Moskowitz, Thomas J. Schnitzer, Arthritis & Rheumatism, Volume 38, Issue 11 , 1995. Pages 1535-1546.) Preferred FGF-18 compounds of the invention are selected from human wildtype FGF-18 or FGF-18(170AA). Compounds of the invention Native or wildtype FGF-18 is a protein expressed by chondrocytes of articular cartilage. The present invention generally relates to the use of an Fibroblast Growth Factor 18 (FGF-18) compound in the treatment of osteoarthritis. An FGF-18 compound of the invention includes for example native or wildtype FGF-18, in particular human FGF-18, bioactive variants thereof, such as bioactive allelic variants, and bioactive truncated forms of FGF-18. The present invention may relate to any variant or modified from of FGF-18 which retains the desired FGF-18 bioactivity as herein described, such as in particular the increase in cartilage deposition. Bioactivities of FGF-18 include in particular those described in the Examples hereinbelow, such as in particular in the in vivo disease models described herein. The nucleotide sequence of the human FGF-18 cDNA is described in SEQ ID NO. 1 , and its deduced amino acid sequence is described in SEQ ID NO. 2. FGF18 was originally designated zFGF-5, and is fully described in U. S. Patents US6,352,971 , US5,989,866 and US Patent Application Publication US2005/0043234, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Analysis of the cDNA encoding a human FGF18 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 1 ) revealed an open reading frame encoding 207 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 2) comprising a mature polypeptide of 180 amino acids (residue 28 to residue 207 of SEQ ID NO: 2). The mouse FGF-18 polynucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 and corresponding amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 were found to have a high degree of homology to that of the human ortholog. At the amino acid level, the mouse and human polypeptides are approximately 98% identical, with three amino acid changes. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the sequences disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4 represent a single allele of the human and mouse FGF18 gene and polypeptide, respectively, and that allelic variation and alternative splicing are expected to occur. As already mentioned, FGF-18 compound of the invention includes for example native or wildtype FGF-18, in particular human FGF-18, bioactive variants thereof, such as bioactive allelic variants, and bioactive truncated forms of FGF-18. The present invention may relate to any variant or modified from of FGF-18 which retains the desired FGF-18 bioactivity as herein described, such as in particular the increase in cartilage deposition. In an embodiment of the present invention FGF-18 compound is a truncated form of human FGF-18. In a particular embodiment said truncated form of FGF-18 comprises or consists of residues 28 to 175 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a functional derivative, or variant or mutein as defined herein. In another embodiment said truncated form of FGF-18 comprises or consists of residues 28 to 176, 28 to 177, 28 to 178, 28 to 179, 28 to 180, 28 to 181 , 28 to 182, 28 to 183, 28 to 184, 28 to 185, 28 to 186, 28 to 187, 28 to 188, 28 to 189, 28 to 190, 28 to 191 , 28 to 192, 28 to 193, 28 to 194 or 28 to 195, 28 to 196, 28 to 197, 28 to 198, 28 to 199, 28 to 200, 28 to 201 , 28 to 202, 28 to 203, 28 to 204, 28 to 205, 28 to 206 or 28 to 207 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a functional derivative, or a variant or mutein as defined herein. These polypeptides, functional derivative, or variant or mutein may comprise an additional N- terminal amino acid residue, preferably a methionine. Indeed, depending on the expression system and conditions, polypeptides of the invention may be expressed in a recombinant host cell with a starting Methionine. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a truncated form of FGF-18, containing 170 amino acids (AA), hereinafter also designated as \"FGF-18(170AA)\". The wild type or naturally occurring form is 207 AA long of which the first 27 AA are the signal sequence and the last 11 AA are deleted in FGF-18(170AA) (as can be demonstrated also for natural occurring FGF-18 in vivo). FGF-18(170AA) may be expressed in E.coli, as there is no signal sequence and the AA sequence starts with a methionine followed by AA28 and ends with AA196. The molecular weight of FGF-18(170AA) is 19.83 kDa, pi ~ 10. FGF-18(170AA) is further described in SEQ ID NO. 5 hereinbelow. FGF-18(170AA) increases chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation and cartilage deposition leading to repair and reconstruction for a variety of cartilaginous tissues. Members of the FGF family are characterized by heparin binding domains. A putative heparin-binding domain for FGF-18 has been identified in the region of amino acid residue 148 (GIy) to amino acid residue 169 (GIn) of SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4. It is postulated that receptor-mediated signaling is initiated upon binding of FGF ligand complexed with cell-surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Many FGF family members can be placed into one of two related families on the basis of their structures and functions. aFGF and bFGF consist of three exons separated by two introns of variable length. FGF-18 consists of five exons, the first three of which correspond to the first exon of aFGF and bFGF. All known FGF family members are spliced to form single polypeptides. Analysis of the ligand-receptor complex of FGF-18 has demonstrated that FGF18 has specificity for FGFR4 and the \"INc\" splice variants of FGFR3 and FGFR2. FGFR3-lllc and FGFR2-lllc are expressed by chondrocytes of cartilage tissue, and in particular, both receptors have been found within human articular cartilage. FGFR3 and FGFR2 have been found in the growth plate of mammals and play important roles in the formation of endochondral and intramembranous bone. FGFR2 is first expressed in condensing mesenchyme and FGFR3 expression is initiated as chondrocytes differentiate and proliferate. In developing cranial bones, FGFR3 is found in the dura mater and periosteum, whereas FGFR2 is expressed in osteoprogenitor cells at the osteogenic front separating the sutures. FGFR2 is also expressed in traebecular bone. Previously, it has been shown that FGF18 is a proliferative agent for chondrocytes and osteoblasts, depending upon both the differentiated state of these cell types and the mode of administration. (See, U. S. Patents 6,352, 971 and 5,989, 866; Ellsworth et al. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, 10: 308-320,2002 ; Shimoaka et al. , J. Bio. Chem. 277 (9) 7493-500,2002). Preferably, the FGF-18 compound of the invention increases cartilage deposition. Such increase may be measured both in vivo and in vitro. Generation of hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage are valuable both as a therapeutic and as component for biological matrices. FGF-18 compounds, such as FGF-18(170AA), and compositions containing FGF-18 compounds (\"FGF-18 compositions\") will be useful in treating articular cartilage defects in synovial joints that are due to age-related superficial fibrillation, cartilage degeneration due to osteoarthritis, and focal chondral and osteochondral defects due to injury or disease. FGF-18 compounds and compositions may also be useful for treating joint disease caused by osteochondritis dissecans and degenerative joint disease. In the field of reconstructive and plastic surgery, FGF-18 compositions will be useful for autogenous or allogenic cartilage expansion and transfer for reconstruction of extensive tissue defects. FGF-18 compounds and compositions may also be useful to expand cells and induce elastic cartilage production. Expansions of cells and induction of elastic cartilage production will be useful for generation and repair of ear and nose tissue. FGF-18 compounds and compositions can also be used to expand chondrocyte populations in culture for autogenous or allogenic chondrocyte transplantation and then administered with or without concurrent treatment consisting of administration of FGF-18 compositions. In these procedures, for example, chondrocytes can be harvested arthroscopically from an uninjured minor load- bearing area of the damaged joint, and can be cultured in the presence of FGF18 compositions to increase the number of cells prior to transplantation. The expanded cultures will then be admixed with FGF-18 compositions, and placed in the joint space or directly into the defect. FGF-18 compositions can be used in combination with periosteal or perichondrial grafts that contain cells that can form cartilage and/or help to hold the transplanted chondrocytes or their precursor cells in place. FGF-18 compositions can be used to repair cartilage damage in conjunction with lavage of the joint, stimulation of bone marrow, abrasion arthroplasty, subchondral drilling, or microfracture of the subchondral bone. Additionally, after the growth of cartilage due to the administration of the FGF-18 composition, additional surgical treatment may be necessary to suitably contour the newly formed cartilage surface. An FGF-18 compound according to the present invention may also be a functional derivative, variant or mutein of a wildtype FGF-18 protein. \"Functional derivatives\" as used herein cover derivatives of FGF-18, and its variants or muteins and fused proteins, which may be prepared from the functional groups which occur as side chains on the residues or the N or C terminal groups, by means known in the art. These functional derivatives are included in the invention as long as they remain pharmaceutically acceptable, i.e. they do not destroy the activity of the protein, which is substantially similar to, or better than, the activity of FGF-18, and do not confer toxic properties on compositions containing it. These derivatives may, for example, include polyethylene glycol side chains, which may improve other properties of the protein, such as stability, half-life, bioavailability, tolerance by the human body, or reduce immunogenicity. To achieve this goal, FGF-18 may be linked e.g. to Polyethlyenglycol (PEG). PEGylation may be carried out by known methods, as for example described in WO 92/13095. In particular, PEG-IFN can be prepared in accordance with the teaching of WO 99/55377. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the functional derivative of FGF-18 comprises at least one moiety attached to one or more functional groups, which occur as one or more side chains on the amino acid residues. An embodiment in which the moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety is highly preferred. In accordance with the present invention, several PEG moieties may also be attached to the FGF-18. Other derivatives include a modified FGF-18 protein, such as a long-acting form of FGF-18. In particular, the long-acting FGF-18 may be selected from pegylated FGF-18, FGF-18-HAS fusion proteins, and FGF-18-Fc-fusion proteins. Other derivatives include aliphatic esters of the carboxyl groups, amides of the carboxyl groups by reaction with ammonia or with primary or secondary amines, N-acyl derivatives of free amino groups of the amino acid residues formed with acyl moieties (e.g. alkanoyl or carbocyclic aroyl groups) or O-acyl derivatives of free hydroxyl groups (for example that of seryl or threonyl residues) formed with acyl moieties. \"Variants\" or \"muteins\", as used in the frame of the present invention, refer to analogs of FGF-18, in which one or more of the amino acid residues of natural FGF-18 are replaced by different amino acid residues, or are deleted, or one or more amino acid residues are added to the natural sequence of FGF-18, without diminishing considerably the activity of the resulting products as compared with the wild type FGF-18. These muteins are prepared by known synthesis and/or by site-directed mutagenesis techniques, or any other known technique suitable therefor. The \"variant\" or \"mutein\" in accordance with the present invention include proteins encoded by a nucleic acid, such as DNA or RNA, which hybridizes to DNA or RNA encoding FGF-18 as disclosed e.g. in US 5,989,866 under stringent conditions. The term \"stringent conditions\" refers to hybridization and subsequent washing conditions, which those of ordinary skill in the art conventionally refer to as \"stringent\". See Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Interscience, N.Y., ¬ß¬ß6.3 and 6.4 (1987, 1992). Without limitation, examples of stringent conditions include washing conditions 12-20 0 C below the calculated Tm of the hybrid under study in, e.g., 2 x SSC and 0.5% SDS for 5 minutes, 2 x SSC and 0.1 % SDS for 15 minutes; 0.1 x SSC and 0.5% SDS at 37¬∞C for 30 60 minutes and then, a 0.1 x SSC and 0.5% SDS at 68¬∞C for 30-60 minutes. Those of ordinary skill in this art understand that stringency conditions also depend on the length of the DNA sequences, oligonucleotide probes (such as 10-40 bases) or mixed oligonucleotide probes. If mixed probes are used, it is preferable to use tetramethyl ammonium chloride (TMAC) instead of SSC. See Ausubel, supra. Identity reflects a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, determined by comparing the sequences. In general, identity refers to an exact nucleotide to nucleotide or amino acid to amino acid correspondence of the two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences, respectively, over the length of the sequences being compared. For sequences where there is not an exact correspondence, a \"% identity\" may be determined. In general, the two sequences to be compared are aligned to give a maximum correlation between the sequences. This may include inserting \"gaps\" in either one or both sequences, to enhance the degree of alignment. A % identity may be determined over the whole length of each of the sequences being compared (so-called global alignment), that is particularly suitable for sequences of the same or very similar length, or over shorter, defined lengths (so-called local alignment), that is more suitable for sequences of unequal length. Methods for comparing the identity and homology and/or similarity of two or more sequences are well known in the art. Thus for instance, programs available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, version 9.1 (Devereux J et al., 1984), for example the programs BESTFIT and GAP, may be used to determine the % identity between two polynucleotides and the % identity and the % homology between two polypeptide sequences. BESTFIT uses the \"local homology\" algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981 ) and finds the best single region of similarity between two sequences. Other programs for determining identity and/or similarity between sequences are also known in the art, for instance the BLAST family of programs (Altschul S F et al, 1990, Altschul S F et al, 1997, accessible through the home page of the NCBI at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and FASTA (Pearson W R, 1990). The \"variant\" or \"mutein\" in accordance with the present invention include proteins having a sequence of amino acids sufficiently duplicative of that of FGF-18, such as to have substantially similar activity to FGF-18. In a preferred embodiment, any such variant or mutein has at least 40% identity or homology with the sequence of FGF-18. More preferably, it has at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or, most preferably, at least 90% identity or homology thereto. Muteins of FGF-18, which can be used in accordance with the present invention, or nucleic acid coding thereof, include a finite set of substantially corresponding sequences as substitution peptides or polynucleotides which can be routinely obtained by one of ordinary skill in the art, without undue experimentation, based on the teachings and guidance presented herein. Preferred changes for muteins in accordance with the present invention are what are known as \"conservative\" substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions of FGF-18 polypeptides may include synonymous amino acids within a group which have sufficiently similar physicochemical properties that substitution between members of the group will preserve the biological function of the molecule (Grantham, 1974). It is clear that insertions and deletions of amino acids may also be made in the above-defined sequences without altering their function, particularly if the insertions or deletions only involve a few amino acids, e.g., under thirty, and preferably under ten, and do not remove or displace amino acids which are critical to a functional conformation, e.g., cysteine residues. Proteins and muteins produced by such deletions and/or insertions come within the purview of the present invention. Preferably, the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table A. More preferably, the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table B; and most preferably the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table C.

Formulation of an FGF18-compound and administration FGF-18 compounds may be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, i.e. together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or the like. The definition of \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" is meant to encompass any carrier, which does not interfere with effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient and that is not toxic to the host to which it is administered. For example, for parenteral administration, the active protein(s) may be formulated in a unit dosage form for injection in vehicles such as saline, dextrose solution, serum albumin and Ringer\\'s solution. Such formulations of FGF-18 compounds including at least one further pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or the like are herein also referred to as \"FGF-18 compositions\". FGF-18 compounds and compositions can be applied by direct injection into the synovial fluid of the joint or directly into the defect, either alone or complexed with a suitable carrier for extended release of protein (such as for example suitable excipients for slow-release formulations, such as e.g. cyclodextrin) or restricted local release (such as, for example, delivery through biocompatible sponges, similar bio-matrixes, encapsulated cells or the like). Formulations for intraarticular (IA) application will comply with most of the requirements that also apply to other injection formulations, i.e., they need to be sterile and compatible with the physiological conditions at the application site (e.g., knee joint, SF). The sterility of solution formulations can be achieved by autoclaving (if all components of the formulation are sufficiently resistant to thermal stress) or sterile filtration, while for other formulations, the manufacturing processes required for ensuring a sterile product may be more complex. For example, sterile filtration is not feasible for formulations containing particles (suspensions), semi-solid or solid formulations. For compatibility of the formulation with the physiological conditions at the site of injection, the characteristics of the SF have to be taken into consideration. Preferably formulations of the invention therefore are isotonic. The pH of the formulations is either close to the pH of SF (i.e., pH7.4) or slightly lower, but preferably not below pH -5.5, to allow for optimum stability of the active ingredient, while minimizing possible side effects of non-physiological pH values such as activation of proteolytic enzymes, e.g., cathepsins. The excipients used for IA injection may also be present in other injection formulations, e.g., for intramuscular or subcutaneous application. In an embodiment of the present invention, the mode of administration of the FGF-18 compound described herein is selected from the group consisting of: intra-auricular administration, peri-auricular administration, intra-nasal administration, peri-nasal administration, endosinusial administration, intra-costal administration, peri-costal administration, intra-thoracic administration, peri-thoracic administration, epidural administration, peri-vertebral administration, peri-synovial administration, intra-synovial administration, endosinusial administration, peri-articular administration and intra-articular administration. In a preferred embodiment, the FGF-18 compound described herein is administered peri-articularly (administration around a joint) or intrarticularly (administration within a joint). In an embodiment of the present invention, the periarticular or intraarticular administration is done around or in a joint selected from joint of the hip, knee, elbow, wrist, ankle, spine, feet, finger, toe, hand, shoulder, ribs, shoulder blades, thighs, shins, heels and along the bony points of the spine. In yet another preferred embodiment the periarticular or intraarticular administration is done around or in a the joint of the hip or the knee. Cartilage disorders The present invention relates to methods of treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of a cartilage disorder in a mammal. Preferably such cartilage disorder result from damages due to traumatic injury or chondropathy. It is understood that preferably humans are patients to be treated according to the present invention; however, it is understood that other mammals, including but not limited to dogs, horses and the like may be treated with methods according to the present invention. Examples of cartilage disorders that may be treated, prevented or ameliorated by the treatment described herein include but are not restricted to: arthritis, osteochondritis, costochondritis (such as Tietze\\'syndrome), osteomyelitis, polychondritis, relapsing polychondritis and Osteochondritis Dissecans. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is arthritis. Preferably, said disease is selected from the group consisting of: ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), gout, pseudogout, infectious arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, scleroderma, Sjogren\\'s syndrome and Still\\'s disease. In a preferred embodiment, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteoarthritis. Arthritis, relates to a damage to articular structures (joints) in the body and related inflammatory processes. Arthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritic joints as a result of injury, and the like, are common inflammatory conditions which would benefit from the therapeutic use of FGF18 according to the present invention. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is arthritis involving the spine. It causes pain and stiffness in the back, and also a bent posture. This is a result of ongoing swelling and irritation of the spinal joints (vertebrae). In severe cases, inflammation of the vertebrae can eventually cause them to fuse together leading to severely limited mobility. Inflammation of the tendons and ligaments that connect and provide support to joints can lead to pain and tenderness in the ribs, shoulder blades, hips, thighs, shins, heels and along the bony points of the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory form of arthritis that affects the spinal joints. The hallmark feature of AS is the involvement of the joints at the base of the spine where the spine joins the pelvis - the sacroiliac (Sl) joints. The disease course is highly variable, and while some individuals have episodes of transient back pain only, others have more chronic severe back pain that leads to differing degrees of spinal stiffness over time. In almost all cases the disease is characterized by acute painful episodes and remissions (periods where the problem settles). Over the years AS has been known by many different names including poker back, rheumatoid spondylitis, and Marie-Strumpells spondylitis. Since the early 70s with increasing knowledge about the disease, there is almost universal use of the term ankylosing spondylitis. AS is a member of the family of diseases that attack the spine. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is characterized by excessive bone growth along the sides of the vertebrae of the spine. It also involves inflammation and bone growth where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, such as at the elbow, knee and the heel of the foot. Bone spurs are common among people with DISH. DISH (sometimes called Forestier\\'s disease) is considered a form of degenerative arthritis and is characterized by excessive bone growth along the sides of the vertebrae of the spine. It is also associated with inflammation and calcification (bone growth) at other areas of the body where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, such as at the elbow, knee and the heel of the foot. These can lead to bone spurs. Heel spurs, for example, are common among people with DISH. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is gout. Gout is a type of arthritis in which uric acid, a waste product that occurs naturally occurring within the body, rises above normal levels. Rather than being flushed by the kidneys and through the urine, as it normally is, it forms crystals and deposits in the joints. These deposits give rise to inflammation of the joints, causing pain, swelling, redness and tenderness of the area. Most typically the joint affected is that of the big toe, but gout can also affect the ankle, knee, foot, hand, wrist and elbow. Uric acid crystals may also form deposits in other areas such as under the skin or in other soft tissues, and in the kidney or urinary tract. Gout typically affects the joint at the base of the big toe. In over half of all initial attacks, this is the first joint affected. Almost any other joint can be affected, but the joints of the lower limbs are more commonly than those of the upper limbs. The majority of initial gout attacks involve only one joint, and, with treatment, subside within three to ten days. Over 50% of people who have had an acute attack of gout will have a recurrence within the year. Over time the attacks may become more frequent, longer lasting and often involve more joints. For some people the attacks linger, and the disease becomes chronic. The crystals of uric acid deposited inside the joint and in the surrounding soft tissues lead to destructive changes in the joint and cause persistent inflammation. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is pseudogout. Pseudogout is a type of arthritis that is caused by the build up of calcium in the body. Pseudogout results from a build up of calcium crystals (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) in a joint. The calcium forms crystals that deposit in the joints between bones. This causes swelling and pain in the area. The calcium deposits and chronic inflammation can cause parts of the joint structure to weaken and break down. With pseudogout cartilage can begin to crack and get holes in it and cause more pain and swelling in the joint. Over time the cartilage may wear away entirely, and the bones rub together. Much of the pain of pseudogout is a result of muscles and the other tissues that help joints move (such as tendons and ligaments) being forced to work in ways for which they were not designed, as a result of damage to the cartilage. Cartilage itself does not have nerve cells, and therefore cannot sense pain, but the muscles, tendons, ligaments and bones do. After many years of cartilage erosion, bones may actually rub together. This grinding of bone against bone adds further to the pain. Bones can also thicken and form growths, called spurs or osteophytes, which rub together. Like the disease gout, pseudogout can come on as sudden, recurrent attacks of pain and swelling in a single joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is infectious arthritis. Infectious arthritis causes pain and swelling in the joints. The inflammation is caused by a germ. The germ can be a bacterium , a virus, or a fungus. There is usually only one joint involved, though sometimes two or three joints can become infected. It does not usually last a long time if it is treated early. Mostly, infectious arthritis affects the large joints (shoulders, hips, knees), but smaller joints (fingers, ankles) can also be involved. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It may be caused by the breakdown of cartilage. Bits of cartilage may break off and cause pain and swelling in the joint between bones. Over time the cartilage may wear away entirely, and the bones will rub together. Osteoarthritis can affect any joint but usually concerns hands and weight-bearing joints such as hips, knees, feet, and spine. The disease state of osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex, multi-factorial progressive disease that is non-inflammatory in nature and which is characterized by a general age-related degradation of articular cartilage in the joints. OA is also characterized by chondrocyte activation leading to cell proliferation and apoptosis, protease expression and abnormal matrix production, failed cartilage repair leading to loss of extracellular matrix, matrix calcification and osteophyte formation. The degradation of cartilage and extracellular matrix structures leads to increased friction between the bones and nerves of the affected joints. OA causes varying levels of pain and progressive debilitation in those afflicted with the disease. Current therapies for OA are palliative or surgical. In healthy joints cartilage acts as a shock absorber when weight is put on the joint. The slippery surface of the cartilage allows the bones to move smoothly. When a joint develops osteoarthritis the cartilage gradually becomes rough and thin, and the bone underneath thickens. Although there is usually no swelling in the early stage of the disease, as the arthritis progresses there can be inflammation. Bits of cartilage may break off and float around inside the joint. This disturbs other soft tissues inside the joint and can cause pain and swelling between bones. Over time as the cartilage wears down, the bones may form bumps on their ends. These bumps are called spurs. Or, the cartilage may wear away entirely, and bones may directly come in contact with each other. OA may lead to other problems such as: the muscles that hold the joint in place weaken because they are not being used, over time the joint looses its shape and does not work at all. OA commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as hips, knees, feet and spine. However, non-weight bearing joints such as finger joints and the joint at the base of the thumb may be affected as well. It usually does not affect other joints, except when they have been injured or been put under unusual stress. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease that mainly involves the synovial membrane of multiple joints with resultant injury to the articular cartilage. The pathogenesis is T lymphocyte dependent and is associated with the production of rheumatoid factors, auto-antibodies directed against self IgG, with the resultant formation of immune complexes that attain high levels in joint fluid and blood. These complexes in the joint may induce the marked infiltrate of lymphocytes and monocytes into the synovium and subsequent marked synovial changes; the joint space/fluid is infiltrated by similar cells with the addition of numerous neutrophils. Tissues affected are primarily the joints, often in symmetrical pattern. Inflammatory cells release enzymes that may digest bone and cartilage. As a result of rheumatoid arthritis, the inflamed joint lining, the synovium, can invade and damage bone and cartilage leading to joint deterioration and severe pain amongst other physiologic effects. The involved joint can lose its shape and alignment, resulting in pain and loss of movement. Therefore RA may lead to severe disability and increased mortality. Joint damage can occur even in cases where the pain is not severe. It can happen even in the early stages of the disease. For many people with RA, damage has shown up on X-rays of the hands and feet within two years of the onset of the disease. But it may be too late to treat by the time X-rays discover the problem. Severe damage can lead to permanent joint deformity and disability. Pain and swelling may cause difficulty walking. A variety of cytokines are produced locally in the rheumatoid joints. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 and TNF-alpha, two prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokines, play an important role in the mechanisms involved in synovial inflammation and in progressive joint destruction. Indeed, the administration of TNF-alpha and IL-1 inhibitors in patients with RA has led to a dramatic improvement of clinical and biological signs of inflammation and a reduction of radiological signs of bone erosion and cartilage destruction. However, despite these encouraging results, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to these agents, suggesting that other mediators are also involved in the pathophysiology of arthritis. One important way to distinguish RA from other forms of arthritis is by the pattern of joint involvement. For example, RA affects the wrist and many of the hand joints but usually not the joints that are most distal joints. In RA, the joints tend to be involved in a symmetrical pattern. That is, if the knuckles on the right hand are inflamed, the knuckles on the left hand are likely to be inflamed as well. Other joints commonly affected by RA include the elbows, shoulders, neck, jaw, feet, ankles, knees, and hips. Other than the neck, the spine usually is not directly affected by RA. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a condition that causes swelling and pain in and around the joints. It also causes a scaly rash on the skin. It can affect a number of joints including the fingers, wrists, toes, knees, ankles, elbows and shoulder joints, the spine and joints in the lower back (called sacroiliac joints). Psoriatic arthritis also affects tissues surrounding the joints including tendons and ligaments. It may cause swelling of a whole digit called \"sausage\" finger or toe. There is also skin inflammation, particularly on the elbows, knees and scalp. Psoriatic arthritis is linked to psoriasis, a disorder causing areas of the skin to become inflamed and be covered with silvery or grey scales. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis refers to pain, stiffness, redness or swelling in a joint resulting from a previous infection. It most often occurs in the joints of the lower limbs (knees, ankles, toes), but can also occur in the upper limbs. Problems may be in the joints only or involve other body systems such as the eyes, skin muscles or tendons. When it affects areas besides the joints, reactive arthritis is then called Reiter\\'s syndrome. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is scleroderma. Scleroderma is a condition where the skin gets thick and hard. There are two main types of scleroderma. One type is localized scleroderma, which affects mainly the skin. It can also involve the muscles and joints. The other type, generalized scleroderma, affects the skin as well as the internal organs, such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The most characteristic feature of scleroderma is the build-up of tough scar-like fibrous tissue in the skin. Less visible changes include damage to the cells lining the walls of small blood vessels. This may in turn damage major organs. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Sjogren\\'s syndrome. Sjogren\\'s syndrome is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the salivary glands resulting in dry mouth, and the tear glands, resulting in dry eyes. It can also affect other parts of the body including joints, muscles and nerves, organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, stomach and brain, or glands such as the thyroid gland. Sjogren\\'s syndrome can cause complete destruction of any of these areas. Since Sjogren\\'s syndrome can affect the liver and pancreas, there is a greater chance of developing cancer of the lymph tissue. However, this is an unusual and rare result. Sjogren\\'s syndrome can occur in two ways. It is \\'secondary\\' Sjogren\\'s syndrome when it occurs in people who have a rheumatic condition or connective tissue disease such as lupus, scleroderma or polymyositis. It is named \\'primary\\' Sjogren\\'s syndrome when dry eyes and mouth are not associated with a rheumatic condition. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Still\\'s disease. Still\\'s disease is a form of arthritis characterized by high spiking fevers, salmon-coloured rashes and inflammation of the joints. The disease is most common among children, for whom it is commonly referred to as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Still\\'s disease can also occur among adults, although much less commonly than for children. In this case it is referred to as adult-onset Still\\'s disease or AOSD. As disclosed here above, cartilage disorders that may be treated, prevented or ameliorated by the treatment described herein include: Osteochondritis Dissecans, costochondritis (such as Tietze\\'syndrome), osteomyelitis, and relapsing polychondritis. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Osteochondritis Dissecans. Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a term for osteochondral fracture. An osteochondral fragment may be present in situ, incompletely detached, or completely detached. OCD is a form of osteochondrosis limited to the articular epiphysis. Articular epiphyses fail as a result of compression. Both trauma and ischemia probably are involved in the pathology. Trauma is most likely the primary insult, with ischemia as secondary injury. Trauma may be caused by direct trauma, such as impaction fracture, or repetitive microtrauma, such as excessive normal compressive stress. The knee joint is the most commonly involved site. However, the elbow joint, the ankle joint, tarsal navicular, hip joint, shoulder joint, Glenoid, wrist joint may also be affected. OCD tends to affect young patients. In OCD of the elbow, patient age averages 23 years and ranges from 4-47 years. In the ankle, patient age averages 20 years and ranges from 8-50 years. In the hip, patient age averages 24 years and ranges from 14-39 years. Patients usually report pain at the extremes of motion range. Periarticular edema often is present with slight warmth to the touch. When a lower extremity is involved, patients often limp. Symptoms usually improve with protected immobilization of the joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is costochondritis. Costochondritis is an inflammation of the junctions where the upper ribs join with the cartilage that holds them to the breastbone or sternum. The cause is usually unknown. When the pain of costochondritis is accompanied by swelling it is referred to as Tietze\\'s syndrome. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory process of the bone and its structures secondary to infection with pyogenic organisms. The infection associated with osteomyelitis may be localized or it may spread through the periosteum, cortex, marrow, and cancellous tissue. The bacterial pathogen varies on the basis of the patient\\'s age and the mechanism of infection. Hematogenous osteomyelitis is an infection caused by bacterial seeding from the blood. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is characterized by an acute infection of the bone caused by the seeding of the bacteria within the bone from a remote source. This condition occurs primarily in children. The most common site is the rapidly growing and highly vascular metaphysis of growing bones. The apparent slowing or sludging of blood flow as the vessels make sharp angles at the distal metaphysis predisposes the vessels to thrombosis and the bone itself to localized necrosis and bacterial seeding. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, despite its name, may have a slow clinical development and insidious onset. Direct or contiguous inoculation osteomyelitis is caused by direct contact of the tissue and bacteria during trauma or surgery. Direct inoculation (contiguous-focus) osteomyelitis is an infection in the bone secondary to the inoculation of organisms from direct trauma, spread from a contiguous focus of infection, or sepsis after a surgical procedure. Clinical manifestations of direct inoculation osteomyelitis are more localized than those of hematogenous osteomyelitis and tend to involve multiple organisms. Additional categories include chronic osteomyelitis and osteomyelitis secondary to peripheral vascular disease. Chronic osteomyelitis persists or recurs, regardless of its initial cause and/or mechanism and despite aggressive intervention. Although listed as an etiology, peripheral vascular disease is actually a predisposing factor rather than a true cause of infection. Disease states known to predispose patients to osteomyelitis include diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), IV drug abuse, alcoholism, chronic steroid use, immunosuppression, and chronic joint disease. In addition the presence of a prosthetic orthopedic device is an independent risk factor as is any recent orthopedic surgery or open fracture. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is relapsing polychondritis. Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an uncommon and severe episodic inflammatory condition involving cartilaginous structures, predominantly those of the ear, nose, and laryngotracheobronchial tree. Other affected structures may include the eye, cardiovascular system, peripheral joints, middle ear, and inner ear. The etiology of this disease is unknown; however, the pathogenesis is most likely autoimmune in nature. Evidence for an autoimmune etiology includes its clinical association with other autoimmune disorders, its association with the HLA-DR4 haplotype, pathology findings of infiltrating CD4 T cells and antigen-antibody complexes in the affected cartilage, cellular and humoral responses against collagen type Il and other collagen antigens, and the observation that immunosuppressive regimens most often suppress the disease. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is cartilage damage resulting from a trauma. Cartilage injuries can occur as a result of traumatic mechanical destruction. A direct blow or other trauma can injure the cartilage. Cartilage has no direct blood supply, thus it has little capacity to repair itself. The methods of the present invention improve cartilage repair. Therefore in an embodiment of the present invention, cartilage damage resulting from a trauma is resulting from an accident or from surgery. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, cartilage damage resulting from a trauma is resulting from surgery, in particular orthopedic surgery or plastic surgery. Also considered by the present invention is the treatment of sport-related injury or sport- related wear of tissues of the joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is an unaesthetic appearance disorder. In such an embodiment, the method and use of the present invention may be used in association to plastic surgery.

EXAMPLE 1 : Disease models in animals and extended pharmacology In vivo, FGF-18(170AA) was tested in different disease models of OA and damaged cartilage, with significant therapeutic efficacy using an intra-articular (i.a.) dosing. Overall a therapeutically effective dose of 3-40 Œºg i.a. per animal/week was demonstrable in different species (rat, dog). Results from the aforementioned animal models of disease (OA as well as cartilage defects) are summarized below. Table 1 : Summary of pharmacology studies with FGF-18(170AA) K* Table 2: Summary of pharmacology studies with FGF-18(170AA) (continued) K* 1 Discussed in more detail below EXAMPLE 1.1 : Rat meniscal tear model of OA Method Male Lewis rats (5-10/group) underwent surgery to induce a medial meniscal tear in the right knee joint. Dosing by the i.a. route was initiated 19-21 days after surgery at doses of 0.3, 1 , 3 or 10 Œºg (formulated in saline) to determine pharmacodynamic effects related to the dosing regimen. These total doses were administered either as (i) single dose, (ii) once weekly (1/3 of total dose per injection) for 3 weeks, or (iii) three times weekly for 3 weeks (1/9 of total dose per injection). At the conclusion of treatment or after 3 weeks post-treatment, right knees were collected for histopathology evaluation of potential effects. Evaluation of the lesions was performed in 3 different zones: regional differences across the medial tibial plateau were taken into consideration by dividing each section into 3 zones (1 -outside, 2-middle, 3-inside). In the surgical OA model, the outside (z1 ) and middle (z2) thirds are usually most severely affected, and milder changes are present on the inside third (z3). Post-treatment or Termination Termination Treatment options: - 1 treatment 1 st week only - 3 treatments 1 per week - 9 treatments 3 per week (weekly doses kept constant) Treatment schedule outline: Experimental Design Animals (5-10/group), housed 2-3/cage, are anesthetized with lsoflurane and the right knee area is prepared for surgery. A skin incision is made over the medial aspect of the knee and the medial collateral ligament is exposed by blunt dissection, and then transected. The medial meniscus is cut through the full thickness to simulate a complete tear. Skin and subcutis are closed with 4-0 Vicryl suture using a subcuticular pattern. Dosing by the intra-articular route is initiated 19-21 days after surgery and is discontinued after a single dose or continued for 3 weeks with intra-articular injections once per week or 3 times per week. Rats are then terminated (g1-16) or allowed to recover for an additional 3 weeks prior to termination (g17- 32). Four hours prior to necropsy, all rats are given 50 mg/kg BRDU to label actively proliferating cells. Blood is collected for serum just prior to necropsy and synovial lavage is done on the right knee. At necropsy, the right (operated) knee joint was trimmed of muscle and connective tissue and collected into 10% neutral buffered formalin. The patella is removed to allow proper fixation of the joints. Trachea, sternum, and ear samples are also placed in formalin. Results evaluated at 6 weeks post surgery Untreated controls (evaluated at 6 weeks post surgery) Untreated animals with medial meniscal tear that were terminated at 6 weeks post surgery had tibial cartilage degeneration which was most severe on the outer 2/3 of the tibial plateau and less severe on the inside 1/3. Osteophytes were large (mean 468 Œºm). Femoral cartilage degeneration was milder and more variable than tibial degeneration. Animals treated with saline once weekly had a significantly lower zone 3 total of tibial cartilage degeneration scores (16%), a significantly lower depth ratio (16%), and a significantly greater area of viable cartilage in the lateral tibia as compared to untreated animals (13%). Animals treated with saline 3 times weekly had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores in zone 2 of the tibia (24%), a significantly lower depth ratio (13%), and significantly greater area of viable cartilage in both the medial and lateral tibia (15 and 14%). These differences in the control groups are likely a result of repeated anesthesia events influencing overall activity of the animals, although the possibility that repeated saline injections influenced lesion severity by facilitating removal of mediators and debris cannot be ruled out. Single dose treatment (evaluated at 6 weeks post surgery) Animals given a single dose of 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had a significantly greater width of total cartilage degeneration (16%) due to an increase in proteoglycan loss in zone 3. Osteophyte scores and measurements were significantly increased (19 and 25%, respectively) in animals given a single dose of 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage matrix in the medial tibia was significantly increased by 27% in animals treated with 10 Œºg. lmmunostaining revealed bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) immunopositivity in fibrotic marrow subjacent to cartilage lesions and in bone marrow cells, fibroblasts, and osteophyte cartilage, with similar staining patterns in saline and FGF-18(170AA) treated joints. These results indicate that a single injection of 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had a definite anabolic effect, as evidenced by increased osteophyte size and increased medial tibial cartilage area. These changes were not, however, sufficient to improve the overall cartilage degeneration scores. It is likely that the increase in medial cartilage area is a result of increased cartilage thickness on the load bearing surface adjacent to the osteophyte. Once weekly for 3 weeks (evaluated at 6 weeks post surgery) Animals treated with 3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) once weekly had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores compared to the saline once weekly control in zone 2 of the medial tibia. Animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had significantly lower significant degeneration width (37%), and those given 3 Œºg (28%) or 1 Œºg (15%) also had some inhibition. Osteophyte scores and measurements were dose responsively and significantly increased by treatment with 10 (32 and 53%) or 3 (21 and 32%) Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage matrix in the medial tibia was significantly increased by treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (27%). Mild to marked chronic active synovitis with fibrosis was evident in joints injected with 10 or 3 Œºg and those injected with 1 Œºg had minimal synovitis. Subchondral bone resorption was minimally increased in a few joints treated with 10 Œºg. Animals treated with 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had increased BRDU labeling in the fibrotic marrow, synovium, and in areas of chondrogenesis or osteophytes, as compared to saline controls. These results demonstrated dose responsive benefit of treatment using the once weekly paradigm on the significant cartilage degeneration width. This parameter is most indicative of the presence of a viable matrix of some type within the defect area and, along with medial tibial cartilage areas, demonstrates the anabolic response. The BRDU labeling results indicate continued proliferative responses after cessation of dosing. Three times weekly for 3 weeks (evaluated at 6 weeks post surgery) Treatment with 1 , 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) administered as 3 injections per week resulted in a significant decrease in tibial cartilage degeneration scores compared to the 3 times weekly saline control in zone 1 (animals treated with 10 Œºg), zone 2 (1or 3 Œºg), and the zone 3 total (1 or 3 Œºg). Treatment with 10 Œºg significantly increased the total tibial cartilage degeneration width by 24%. Treatment with 1 or 3 Œºg nonsignificantly decreased cartilage degeneration width by 24% and 21 % respectively, indicating some beneficial effect. Animals treated with 1 or 3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) also had significantly lower depth ratios (17% and 18% respectively) than saline controls. The medial tibial osteophyte score was increased after treatment with 0.3, 1 , 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (13%, 7%, 13% and 15% respectively), while all 4 doses (0.3, 1 , 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA)) significantly increased the osteophyte measurement (12, 18, 60 and 62 %, respectively. Treatment with 10 Œºg significantly increased the femoral cartilage degeneration score by 114%. Bone scores were significantly increased by treatment with 3 (60%) or 10 (88%) Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The total joint score without femur was significantly decreased by treatment with 3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (13%), but the addition of the femur to the total joint score eliminated that variation. Treatment with 1 , 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased the area of viable cartilage in the medial tibia (13%, 29% and 29%), and treatment with 3 or 10 Œºg significantly increased area in the lateral tibia (22% and 13%). Joints injected with 3 or 10 Œºg had marked to severe synovitis with increased subchondral bone resorption and similar but mild to moderate changes were observed in joints treated with 1 Œºg. Animals treated with 1 , 30 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had BRDU labeling in numerous areas including marrow, osteophytes, meniscus, synovium, and areas of chondrogenesis. These results demonstrated the most pronounced anabolic effects of any treatment paradigm, but were accompanied by severe synovial inflammation and increased subchondral bone resorption. Results evaluated at 9 weeks post surgery Untreated controls (evaluated at 9 weeks post surgery) Untreated animals with medial meniscal tear that were terminated at 9 weeks had tibial cartilage degeneration which was most severe on the outer 2/3 of the tibial plateau and less severe on the inside 1/3. Femoral cartilage degeneration was less severe and more variable. Scores were, in general, higher than in untreated animals terminated at week 6. Single dose saline controls had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores in zone 2 of the tibia (12%) than those of the once weekly saline controls (18%). Single dose saline controls also had significantly greater width of moderate collagen degeneration (92%). Animals given saline once weekly had a significantly lower sum of severe, marked, moderate, and mild collagen degeneration (15%), as those of the 3 times weekly saline control animals (22%). These differences were relatively minor since there were only 5 rats in each of these groups and were a result of variation in disease progression in individuals. Single dose (evaluated at 9 weeks post surgery, incl. 3 weeks post-treatment) There was no significant effect of treatment in any animals given a single dose of FGF- 18(170AA) and terminated 9 weeks after surgery, although a few joints injected with 10 Œºg had evidence of anabolic response on the lateral tibia. Once weekly for 3 weeks (evaluated at 9 weeks post surgery, incl. 3 weeks post-treatment) After treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) once weekly, significant decreases in cartilage degeneration scores in zone 1 and zone 3 total of the medial tibia by 38 and 31 % were observed. Treatment with 0.3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly reduced scores in zone 2 compared to the once weekly saline control. Animals treated with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had significantly lower significant cartilage degeneration width (38%). Depth ratios were significantly decreased by treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (22%). Treatment with 3 or 10 Œºg FGF- 18(170AA) significantly and identically increased osteophyte scores (25%), but only animals given 10 Œºg had significantly increased osteophyte measurements (53%). There was a 23% significant decrease in total joint score with femur in animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage was significantly increased in animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) in both the medial (40%) and lateral (81 %) tibia. Treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly reduced the width of severe and minimal collagen degeneration, as well as the width of severe, marked, and moderated degeneration combined and the width of severe and marked combined. Synovial inflammation was minimal in joints injected with 3 or 10 Œºg and absent at lower doses. Anabolic responses were evident in some or all joints injected with any dose. BRDU labeling was seen mainly in bone marrow and fibroblasts of saline controls and increased labeling (cartilage and osteophytes) was seen in joints injected with 10 Œºg. These results indicated that the cartilage repair/anabolic responses continued beyond the treatment period and that synovitis subsided, although osteophyte measures were comparable at 6 or 9 weeks in joints treated with this dose. Dose responsive benefit was seen using the significant cartilage degeneration parameter and severe matrix loss, as measured by collagen degeneration, was improved. Three times weekly for 3 weeks (evaluated at 9 weeks post surgery, incl. 3 weeks post- treatment) The zone 3 total tibial cartilage degeneration score was significantly decreased by 38% in animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) as 3 injections weekly, as compared to the 3 times weekly saline control. Treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) also significantly decreased the significant cartilage degeneration width (48%). The depth ratio was significantly decreased by 27% in animals treated with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA). Osteophyte measurements were significantly increased in animals treated with 3 (57%) or 10 (103%) Œºg FGF-18(170AA). Treatment with 1 , 3, or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased the area of viable cartilage in the medial tibia (34%, 37% and 71 % respectively), while treatment with 0.3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased areas in the lateral tibia (46% and 67%). Mild collagen degeneration width was significantly increased in animals treated with 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA), as was the width of mild and minimal degeneration combined in animals given 10 Œºg. Mild synovitis was present in all joints injected with 10 Œºg (divided) and minimal to mild synovitis was present in those given 1 or 3 Œºg. Anabolic responses were evident from 1 Œºg upwards. BRDU labeling was seen mainly in bone marrow and fibroblasts of saline controls and increased labeling (cartilage and osteophytes) was seen in joints injected with 10 Œºg. These results indicated that the cartilage repair/anabolic responses continued beyond the treatment period and that synovitis subsided as compared to the 6 week time point. Beneficial effects on collagen loss were less clear, although there was a definite trend towards smaller measurements for the areas of marked to severe loss. EXAMPLE 1.2: Dog menisectomy model of OA Female beagle dogs (n=3/group) that had had unilateral partial medial menisectomy on the left knee one month prior to initiation of treatment were treated with saline or 3, 10, or 30 Œºg FGF- 18(170AA) once, once weekly, or three times weekly (divided 1/3 doses) for 3 weeks to determine beneficial effects on established OA. After 3 weeks of treatment, left knees were evaluated for effects on gross (n=3/group) and microscopic (n=3/group) changes induced by menisectomy and for evidence of anabolic effects. All dogs except one exhibited normal appetite and activity throughout the study. One dog (YLI- 8) from group 12 died prior to termination (day 17) due to aspiration pneumonia associated with repeated anesthesia for joint injections. Typical degenerative changes characterized by the presence of focal, well circumscribed lesions of cartilage degeneration were present on the medial tibias of all operated dogs in all groups. Femoral lesions were sporadically observed. All dogs had minimal medial joint capsule thickening. Meniscal damage (approximately 1/2 absent at necropsy with generally none to moderate repair) was similar in all groups. Microscopic evaluation revealed that untreated and vehicle treated knees often had cartilage hypertrophy with cloning in the zone 1 of levels 1 and 2. Definite anabolic effects (increased cloning, cellularity, and proteoglycan staining in lesion areas) were observed in knees treated with 30 Œºg (10 Œºg three times weekly) FGF-18(170AA), and these changes were most identifiable on femoral condyles. Lesser, but still convincing anabolic effects were observed in some knees treated 3 times weekly with the lower doses of FGF-18(170AA), or in knees treated with 30 or 10 Œºg once weekly. When present, these FGF-18(170AA) induced changes were generally in the upper 1/3 to 1/2 of the cartilage or in matrix adjacent to deeper clefts. Results of this study demonstrated definite anabolic effects of i.a. treatment with 10 Œºg FGF- 18(170AA) 3 times weekly (30 Œºg total/week) in all knees and lesser effects in some knees treated with lower doses 3 times weekly or with 30 or 10 Œºg once weekly. The changes consisted of cloning, increased proteoglycan synthesis in the upper 1/3 to 1/2 of the cartilage or in matrix adjacent to clefts. Mild marginal zone proliferative changes were observed in some joints but there were no excessive changes similar to those occurring in rats. The anabolic changes in articular cartilage were greater than the anabolic changes in marginal zones in all cases. Collagen damage measurements also suggested some protection of matrix integrity. EXAMPLE 1.3: Dog anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) model For investigations on severe progressive osteoarthritis, the dog anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) model is used for pre-clinical pharmacology investigations, including MRI evaluation at end of treatment and at follow up. This model provides efficacy data (histopathological and MRI over time and follow up) together with data on function by means of gait analysis. Using a non-invasive read-out MRI already at end of treatment a decrease in cartilage lesions compared to healthy baseline was demonstrable (-13.3, -7.5, -9.3 and -8.8 for vehicle, 3 Œºg/joint, 10 Œºg/joint and 30 Œºg/joint, respectively). Also a functional improvement measured via gait analysis on force plate is demonstrable at end of therapy: Gait analysis was performed using a platform-based pressure/force measurement (Matscan¬Æ System, Tekscan Inc, Boston, MA, USA). Gait acquisition procedures The Matscan¬Æ System comprises 4 walkway floor displays, each having 2,288 sensing elements included in a sensing area of 432 mm X 368 mm, producing a spatial resolution of 1.4 sensels/cm2. This device was calibrated with a predefined weight at the beginning of the study and the same calibration was used for all dogs throughout the study. For the osteoarthritis-induced hind limb, the peak vertical force and the contact area were acquired at a trotting gait velocity ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 meters/second. Velocity was ensured using a chronometer. The gait acquisition window was 3 seconds with a sampling rate set at 44 hertz, producing a total of 132 frames. The first 5 valid trials were obtained for each dog and then averaged to characterize the dog profile at a given point in time. The peak vertical force was expressed in percentage of body weight (%BW) and the contact area was expressed in square centimeters (cm2). With regard to the peak vertical force of the osteoarthritis-induced hind limb acquired at the trot, the canine osteoarthritis model produced an abnormal gait (week 4) discernable over preoperative values (baseline). The peak vertical force and the contact area were decreased 4 and 8 weeks following surgery as negative changes were observed in all groups (Tables 3 & 4). There was however a trend for dogs in Group IV at 8 weeks following surgery to have a less severe decrease compared to baseline vis-a-vis the other groups.

The results of in vitro pharmacology demonstrated specific activity on chondrocytes (proliferation and cartilage regeneration/collagen synthesis) and the absence of adverse effects like leukocyte proliferation or cytokine release by different cell types after exposure to FGF- 18(170AA). EXAMPLE 1.4: Investigations using radiolabeled FGF18 [3H]-FGFI 8 The levels of radioactivity found in the joint knee articulation following intra-articular administration of [3H]-FGFI 8 are reported in table 5 (as concentrations of total radioactivity, expressed as ng equivalents/g) and in table 6 (expressed as percentages of administered dose); in the tables are reported the radioactivity levels determined in the treated articulations analyzed both as intact knee joint and after collection of the synovial fluid. The corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters in joint knee articulation, either with or without the synovial fluid, are reported in table 7.

Systemic exposure parameters of total radioactivity in joint knee articulation following aa ssiinnggllee iinnttrraa--aarrttiiccuullar administration of [ 3 H]-AS902330 at a target dose level of 0.24 mg/kg to male rats. The levels of total radioactivity in the treated articulation declined bi-phasically (, with a terminal half-life of 20 hours. A comparable value was obtained taking into account the whole articulation without synovial fluid (16 hours). Overall, the results indicated that the total radioactivity distributed outside the synovial fluid into the tissues of the knee articulation. The results obtained after autoradioluminography analysis of the treated knee joints shown that most of the radioactivity was localized in close proximity to the articulation. The results of whole body autoradioluminography analyses after intravenous administration and intra-articular administration of [ 3 H]-FGFI 8 are reported in table 8 and in table 9, respectively. Concentrations of total radioactivity in tissues and organs are expressed as ng equivalents/g (Mean ¬± SD).

Results are expressed as ng equivalents/g (Mean ¬± SD). NQ: Not quantifiable (below limit of quantification) After intravenous administration the total radioactivity in blood and serum reached the highest value at 4 hours and 24 hours after administration, in serum and blood, respectively. The measured half live in serum was about 55 hours. After intra- articular administration the means of total radioactivity increased slowly reaching the highest concentration at 24 and 48 hours after administration, in serum and blood, respectively. The systemic exposure was approximately 20% of that found after intravenous administration. Total radioactivity in serum was on average higher than that in blood, suggesting that the parent compound and/or its metabolites had low affinity for blood cells and circulating radioactivity was mainly distributed in serum. The levels of total radioactivity in the treated articulation declined bi-phasically with a terminal half-life of 20 hours. Overall, the results indicated that the total radioactivity distributed outside the synovial fluid into the knee articulation. Overall, based on the non-clinical pharmacology models in rat and dog, it is found that a particularly appropriate dosing regimen is once weekly for three weeks.

More specifically, it relates to the use of FGF-18 in treatment regimens and for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of patients having a cartilage disorder such as osteoarthritis, such as for example knee osteoarthritis or secondary hip osteoarthritis. Specifically provided is a preferred treatment scheme comprising once weekly administration of an FGF-18 compound per treatment cycle. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FGF18 was identified as a member of the FGF family which was most closely related to FGF8 and FGF17. Activities associated with FGF18 include stimulation of mesenchymal lineage cells, in particular cardiac myocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes (U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,971). FGF18 binds and activates FGFR4 and the IIIc splice variant of FGFR3 and FGFR2. Bone remodeling is the dynamic process by which tissue mass and skeletal architecture are maintained. The process is a balance between bone resorption and bone formation, with two cell types thought to be the major players. These cells are the osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts synthesize and deposit matrix to become new bone. The activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are regulated by many factors, systemic and local, including growth factors. Cartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. It is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are dispersed in a firm, gel-like ground substance, called the matrix. Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, in the throat and between intervertebral disks. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. The main purpose of cartilage is to provide a framework upon which bone deposition could begin. Another important purpose of cartilage is to provide smooth surfaces and mechanical protection for the movement of articulating bones. Replacement of damaged cartilage, in particular articular cartilage, caused either by injury or disease is a major challenge for physicians, and available treatments are considered unpredictable and effective for only a limited time. Virtually all currently available treatments for cartilage damage focus on pain relief, with little or no efficacy on regeneration of damaged tissues. Therefore, the majority of younger patients either do not seek treatment or are counseled to postpone treatment for as long as possible. When treatment is required, the standard procedure is total joint replacement or microfracture, a procedure that involves penetration of the subchondral bone to stimulate fibrocartilage deposition by chondrocytes. For patients with osteoarthritis, non-surgical treatment consists of physical therapy, lifestyle modification (e.g. reducing activity), bracing, supportive devices, oral and injection drugs (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and medical management. Surgical options are very specific to osteoarthritis severity and can provide a reduction in symptoms that are generally only short lived. Tibial or femoral osteotomics (cutting the bone to rebalance joint wear) may reduce symptoms, help to maintain an active lifestyle, and delay the need for total joint replacement. Total joint replacement can provide relief for the symptom of advanced osteoarthritis, but generally requires a change in a patient's lifestyle and/or activity level. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method for treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of cartilage disorders that would permit regeneration of damaged tissue. In addition, it would be desirable that such method be as safe and effective as possible. Moreover, as cartilage disorders may be chronic diseases, it would be desirable that such method permits re-treatments of the patient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for treating a patient having a cartilage disorder comprising the administration of an FGF-18 compound wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the cartilage disorder to be treated is osteoarthritis, the FGF-18 compound is the FGF-18 fragment designated herein as FGF-18(170AA) and the posology cycle is 10 to 30 mcg per intra-articular injection once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (one treatment cycle). In a preferred embodiment such treatment cycles may be repeated after 4 or 6 months. For example, where a treatment cycle is repeated after 6 months, if a first treatment cycle is started e.g. in January of a given year, then a second treatment cycle may be started in July of said year. Further provided herein is the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. Also provided herein is the use of an FGF-18 compound for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. Provided herein is also the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder, the medicament being adapted to be administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides suitable treatment modalities, including suitable administration schemes for the treatment of various cartilage disorders, such as in particular osteoarthritis, with FGF-18 compounds, such as for example the FGF-18(170AA) protein fragment. In the context of the present invention it has been surprisingly found that FGF-18 compounds have optimal disease- or symptom-ameliorating effects on cartilage disorders when administered according to the methods and uses disclosed herein. It has been found that less frequent dosing schedules than contemplated by the present invention may not be fully effective, whereas more frequent dosing than contemplated by the present invention may cause inflammation and/or other counterproductive effects on the cartilage or joint environment when the same or comparable dosages as those contemplated by the present invention are being used. Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for treating a patient having a cartilage disorder comprising the administration of an FGF-18 compound wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. For example, where administrations are separated by about 4 days, a second administration may be made about 96 hours after a first administration; e.g. where and administration is given on day 1 in, for example, the morning, there will be 3 calendar days where the patient will not receive an administration (day 2, day 3, day 4) and the patient will again receive an administration on day 5 in the morning. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by about 7 days. In another aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by about 7 days. In a preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about 7 days each. Preferably, the FGF-18 compound is administered in regular intervals once per week. In an embodiment of the present invention there is provided the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder the medicament being adapted to be administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by about 7 days.

In a preferred embodiment the treatment comprises administration at a dose of 80, 90, 100, 110 or 120 mcg/kg per single intravenous administration of the FGF-18 compound. In a preferred embodiment the cartilage disorder treated by any of the methods of the invention is osteoarthritis, such as for example osteoarthritis which is classified as stage II or stage III according to OARSI. In a preferred example the osteoarthritis may be knee osteoarthritis or hip osteoarthritis, such as secondary hip osteoarthritis. The skilled person is fully aware of osteoarthritis classifications that are used in the art. In particular, the OARSI classification is known in the art. The skilled person may reference the ‚ÄúGuidelines for the medical management of osteoarthritis‚Äù (Marc C. Hochberg, Roy D. Altman, Kenneth D. Brandt, Bruce M. Clark, Paul A. Dieppe, Marie R. Griffin, Roland W. Moskowitz, Thomas J. Schnitzer, Arthritis & Rheumatism, Volume 38, Issue 11, 1995. Pages 1535-1546.) Preferred FGF-18 compounds of the invention are selected from human wildtype FGF-18 or FGF-18(170AA). Compounds of the Invention Native or wildtype FGF-18 is a protein expressed by chondrocytes of articular cartilage. The present invention generally relates to the use of an Fibroblast Growth Factor 18 (FGF-18) compound in the treatment of osteoarthritis. An FGF-18 compound of the invention includes for example native or wildtype FGF-18, in particular human FGF-18, bioactive variants thereof, such as bioactive allelic variants, and bioactive truncated forms of FGF-18. The present invention may relate to any variant or modified from of FGF-18 which retains the desired FGF-18 bioactivity as herein described, such as in particular the increase in cartilage deposition. Bioactivities of FGF-18 include in particular those described in the Examples hereinbelow, such as in particular in the in vivo disease models described herein. The nucleotide sequence of the human FGF-18 cDNA is described in SEQ ID NO. 1, and its deduced amino acid sequence is described in SEQ ID NO. 2. FGF18 was originally designated zFGF-5, and is fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,971, U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,866 and US Patent Application Publication US2005/0043234, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Analysis of the cDNA encoding a human FGF18 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 1) revealed an open reading frame encoding 207 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 2) comprising a mature polypeptide of 180 amino acids (residue 28 to residue 207 of SEQ ID NO: 2). The mouse FGF-18 polynucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 and corresponding amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 were found to have a high degree of homology to that of the human ortholog. At the amino acid level, the mouse and human polypeptides are approximately 98% identical, with three amino acid changes. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the sequences disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4 represent a single allele of the human and mouse FGF18 gene and polypeptide, respectively, and that allelic variation and alternative splicing are expected to occur. As already mentioned, FGF-18 compound of the invention includes for example native or wildtype FGF-18, in particular human FGF-18, bioactive variants thereof, such as bioactive allelic variants, and bioactive truncated forms of FGF-18. The present invention may relate to any variant or modified from of FGF-18 which retains the desired FGF-18 bioactivity as herein described, such as in particular the increase in cartilage deposition. In an embodiment of the present invention FGF-18 compound is a truncated form of human FGF-18. In a particular embodiment said truncated form of FGF-18 comprises or consists of residues 28 to 175 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a functional derivative, or variant or mutein as defined herein. In another embodiment said truncated form of FGF-18 comprises or consists of residues 28 to 176, 28 to 177, 28 to 178, 28 to 179, 28 to 180, 28 to 181, 28 to 182, 28 to 183, 28 to 184, 28 to 185, 28 to 186, 28 to 187, 28 to 188, 28 to 189, 28 to 190, 28 to 191, 28 to 192, 28 to 193, 28 to 194 or 28 to 195, 28 to 196, 28 to 197, 28 to 198, 28 to 199, 28 to 200, 28 to 201, 28 to 202, 28 to 203, 28 to 204, 28 to 205, 28 to 206 or 28 to 207 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a functional derivative, or a variant or mutein as defined herein. These polypeptides, functional derivative, or variant or mutein may comprise an additional N-terminal amino acid residue, preferably a methionine. Indeed, depending on the expression system and conditions, polypeptides of the invention may be expressed in a recombinant host cell with a starting Methionine. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a truncated form of FGF-18, containing 170 amino acids (AA), hereinafter also designated as ‚ÄúFGF-18(170AA)‚Äù. The wild type or naturally occurring form is 207 AA long of which the first 27 AA are the signal sequence and the last 11 AA are deleted in FGF-18(170AA) (as can be demonstrated also for natural occurring FGF-18 in vivo). FGF-18(170AA) may be expressed in E. coli, as there is no signal sequence and the AA sequence starts with a methionine followed by AA28 and ends with AA196. The molecular weight of FGF-18(170AA) is 19.83 kDa, plÀú10. FGF-18(170AA) is further described in SEQ ID NO. 5 hereinbelow. FGF-18(170AA) increases chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation and cartilage deposition leading to repair and reconstruction for a variety of cartilaginous tissues. Members of the FGF family are characterized by heparin binding domains. A putative heparin-binding domain for FGF-18 has been identified in the region of amino acid residue 148 (Gly) to amino acid residue 169 (Gln) of SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4. It is postulated that receptor-mediated signaling is initiated upon binding of FGF ligand complexed with cell-surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Many FGF family members can be placed into one of two related families on the basis of their structures and functions. aFGF and bFGF consist of three exons separated by two introns of variable length. FGF-18 consists of five exons, the first three of which correspond to the first exon of aFGF and bFGF. All known FGF family members are spliced to form single polypeptides. Analysis of the ligand-receptor complex of FGF-18 has demonstrated that FGF18 has specificity for FGFR4 and the ‚ÄúIIIc‚Äù splice variants of FGFR3 and FGFR2. FGFR3-IIIc and FGFR2-IIIc are expressed by chondrocytes of cartilage tissue, and in particular, both receptors have been found within human articular cartilage. FGFR3 and FGFR2 have been found in the growth plate of mammals and play important roles in the formation of endochondral and intramembranous bone. FGFR2 is first expressed in condensing mesenchyme and FGFR3 expression is initiated as chondrocytes differentiate and proliferate. In developing cranial bones, FGFR3 is found in the dura mater and periosteum, whereas FGFR2 is expressed in osteoprogenitor cells at the osteogenic front separating the sutures. FGFR2 is also expressed in traebecular bone. Previously, it has been shown that FGF18 is a proliferative agent for chondrocytes and osteoblasts, depending upon both the differentiated state of these cell types and the mode of administration. (See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,352,971 and 5,989,866; Ellsworth et al. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, 10: 308-320, 2002; Shimoaka et al. , J. Bio. Chem. 277 (9) 7493-500, 2002). Preferably, the FGF-18 compound of the invention increases cartilage deposition. Such increase may be measured both in vivo and in vitro. Generation of hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage are valuable both as a therapeutic and as component for biological matrices. FGF-18 compounds, such as FGF-18(170AA), and compositions containing FGF-18 compounds (‚ÄúFGF-18 compositions‚Äù) will be useful in treating articular cartilage defects in synovial joints that are due to age-related superficial fibrillation, cartilage degeneration due to osteoarthritis, and focal chondral and osteochondral defects due to injury or disease. FGF-18 compounds and compositions may also be useful for treating joint disease caused by osteochondritis dissecans and degenerative joint disease. In the field of reconstructive and plastic surgery, FGF-18 compositions will be useful for autogenous or allogenic cartilage expansion and transfer for reconstruction of extensive tissue defects. FGF-18 compounds and compositions may also be useful to expand cells and induce elastic cartilage production. Expansions of cells and induction of elastic cartilage production will be useful for generation and repair of ear and nose tissue. FGF-18 compounds and compositions can also be used to expand chondrocyte populations in culture for autogenous or allogenic chondrocyte transplantation and then administered with or without concurrent treatment consisting of administration of FGF-18 compositions. In these procedures, for example, chondrocytes can be harvested arthroscopically from an uninjured minor load-bearing area of the damaged joint, and can be cultured in the presence of FGF18 compositions to increase the number of cells prior to transplantation. The expanded cultures will then be admixed with FGF-18 compositions, and placed in the joint space or directly into the defect. FGF-18 compositions can be used in combination with periosteal or perichondrial grafts that contain cells that can form cartilage and/or help to hold the transplanted chondrocytes or their precursor cells in place. FGF-18 compositions can be used to repair cartilage damage in conjunction with lavage of the joint, stimulation of bone marrow, abrasion arthroplasty, subchondral drilling, or microfracture of the subchondral bone. Additionally, after the growth of cartilage due to the administration of the FGF-18 composition, additional surgical treatment may be necessary to suitably contour the newly formed cartilage surface. An FGF-18 compound according to the present invention may also be a functional derivative, variant or mutein of a wildtype FGF-18 protein. ‚ÄúFunctional derivatives‚Äù as used herein cover derivatives of FGF-18, and its variants or muteins and fused proteins, which may be prepared from the functional groups which occur as side chains on the residues or the N or C terminal groups, by means known in the art. These functional derivatives are included in the invention as long as they remain pharmaceutically acceptable, i.e. they do not destroy the activity of the protein, which is substantially similar to, or better than, the activity of FGF-18, and do not confer toxic properties on compositions containing it. These derivatives may, for example, include polyethylene glycol side chains, which may improve other properties of the protein, such as stability, half-life, bioavailability, tolerance by the human body, or reduce immunogenicity. To achieve this goal, FGF-18 may be linked e.g. to Polyethlyenglycol (PEG). PEGylation may be carried out by known methods, as for example described in WO 92/13095. In particular, PEG-IFN can be prepared in accordance with the teaching of WO 99/55377. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the functional derivative of FGF-18 comprises at least one moiety attached to one or more functional groups, which occur as one or more side chains on the amino acid residues. An embodiment in which the moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety is highly preferred. In accordance with the present invention, several PEG moieties may also be attached to the FGF-18. Other derivatives include a modified FGF-18 protein, such as a long-acting form of FGF-18. In particular, the long-acting FGF-18 may be selected from pegylated FGF-18, FGF-18-HAS fusion proteins, and FGF-18-Fc-fusion proteins. Other derivatives include aliphatic esters of the carboxyl groups, amides of the carboxyl groups by reaction with ammonia or with primary or secondary amines, N-acyl derivatives of free amino groups of the amino acid residues formed with acyl moieties (e.g. alkanoyl or carbocyclic aroyl groups) or O-acyl derivatives of free hydroxyl groups (for example that of seryl or threonyl residues) formed with acyl moieties. ‚ÄúVariants‚Äù or ‚Äúmuteins‚Äù, as used in the frame of the present invention, refer to analogs of FGF-18, in which one or more of the amino acid residues of natural FGF-18 are replaced by different amino acid residues, or are deleted, or one or more amino acid residues are added to the natural sequence of FGF-18, without diminishing considerably the activity of the resulting products as compared with the wild type FGF-18. These muteins are prepared by known synthesis and/or by site-directed mutagenesis techniques, or any other known technique suitable therefor. The ‚Äúvariant‚Äù or ‚Äúmutein‚Äù in accordance with the present invention include proteins encoded by a nucleic acid, such as DNA or RNA, which hybridizes to DNA or RNA encoding FGF-18 as disclosed e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,866 under stringent conditions. The term ‚Äústringent conditions‚Äù refers to hybridization and subsequent washing conditions, which those of ordinary skill in the art conventionally refer to as ‚Äústringent‚Äù. See Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Interscience, N.Y., ¬ß¬ß6.3 and 6.4 (1987, 1992). Without limitation, examples of stringent conditions include washing conditions 12-20¬∞ C. below the calculated Tm of the hybrid under study in, e.g., 2√óSSC and 0.5% SDS for 5 minutes, 2√óSSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes; 0.1√óSSC and 0.5% SDS at 37¬∞ C. for 30 60 minutes and then, a 0.1√óSSC and 0.5% SDS at 68¬∞ C. for 30-60 minutes. Those of ordinary skill in this art understand that stringency conditions also depend on the length of the DNA sequences, oligonucleotide probes (such as 10-40 bases) or mixed oligonucleotide probes. If mixed probes are used, it is preferable to use tetramethyl ammonium chloride (TMAC) instead of SSC. See Ausubel, supra. Identity reflects a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, determined by comparing the sequences. In general, identity refers to an exact nucleotide to nucleotide or amino acid to amino acid correspondence of the two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences, respectively, over the length of the sequences being compared. For sequences where there is not an exact correspondence, a ‚Äú% identity‚Äù may be determined. In general, the two sequences to be compared are aligned to give a maximum correlation between the sequences. This may include inserting ‚Äúgaps‚Äù in either one or both sequences, to enhance the degree of alignment. A % identity may be determined over the whole length of each of the sequences being compared (so-called global alignment), that is particularly suitable for sequences of the same or very similar length, or over shorter, defined lengths (so-called local alignment), that is more suitable for sequences of unequal length. Methods for comparing the identity and homology and/or similarity of two or more sequences are well known in the art. Thus for instance, programs available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, version 9.1 (Devereux J et al., 1984), for example the programs BESTFIT and GAP, may be used to determine the % identity between two polynucleotides and the % identity and the % homology between two polypeptide sequences. BESTFIT uses the ‚Äúlocal homology‚Äù algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) and finds the best single region of similarity between two sequences. Other programs for determining identity and/or similarity between sequences are also known in the art, for instance the BLAST family of programs (Altschul S F et al, 1990, Altschul S F et al, 1997, accessible through the home page of the NCBI at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and FASTA (Pearson W R, 1990). The ‚Äúvariant‚Äù or ‚Äúmutein‚Äù in accordance with the present invention include proteins having a sequence of amino acids sufficiently duplicative of that of FGF-18, such as to have substantially similar activity to FGF-18. In a preferred embodiment, any such variant or mutein has at least 40% identity or homology with the sequence of FGF-18. More preferably, it has at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or, most preferably, at least 90% identity or homology thereto. Muteins of FGF-18, which can be used in accordance with the present invention, or nucleic acid coding thereof, include a finite set of substantially corresponding sequences as substitution peptides or polynucleotides which can be routinely obtained by one of ordinary skill in the art, without undue experimentation, based on the teachings and guidance presented herein. Preferred changes for muteins in accordance with the present invention are what are known as ‚Äúconservative‚Äù substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions of FGF-18 polypeptides may include synonymous amino acids within a group which have sufficiently similar physicochemical properties that substitution between members of the group will preserve the biological function of the molecule (Grantham, 1974). It is clear that insertions and deletions of amino acids may also be made in the above-defined sequences without altering their function, particularly if the insertions or deletions only involve a few amino acids, e.g., under thirty, and preferably under ten, and do not remove or displace amino acids which are critical to a functional conformation, e.g., cysteine residues. Proteins and muteins produced by such deletions and/or insertions come within the purview of the present invention. Preferably, the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table A. More preferably, the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table B; and most preferably the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table C.

No. 5,017,691 to Lee et al; and lysine substituted proteins presented in U.S. Pat. No. 4,904,584 (Shaw et al). Formulation of an FGF18-Compound and Administration FGF-18 compounds may be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, i.e. together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or the like. The definition of ‚Äúpharmaceutically acceptable‚Äù is meant to encompass any carrier, which does not interfere with effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient and that is not toxic to the host to which it is administered. For example, for parenteral administration, the active protein(s) may be formulated in a unit dosage form for injection in vehicles such as saline, dextrose solution, serum albumin and Ringer's solution. Such formulations of FGF-18 compounds including at least one further pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or the like are herein also referred to as ‚ÄúFGF-18 compositions‚Äù. FGF-18 compounds and compositions can be applied by direct injection into the synovial fluid of the joint or directly into the defect, either alone or complexed with a suitable carrier for extended release of protein (such as for example suitable excipients for slow-release formulations, such as e.g. cyclodextrin) or restricted local release (such as, for example, delivery through biocompatible sponges, similar bio-matrixes, encapsulated cells or the like). Formulations for intraarticular (IA) application will comply with most of the requirements that also apply to other injection formulations, i.e., they need to be sterile and compatible with the physiological conditions at the application site (e.g., knee joint, SF). The sterility of solution formulations can be achieved by autoclaving (if all components of the formulation are sufficiently resistant to thermal stress) or sterile filtration, while for other formulations, the manufacturing processes required for ensuring a sterile product may be more complex. For example, sterile filtration is not feasible for formulations containing particles (suspensions), semi-solid or solid formulations. For compatibility of the formulation with the physiological conditions at the site of injection, the characteristics of the SF have to be taken into consideration. Preferably formulations of the invention therefore are isotonic. The pH of the formulations is either close to the pH of SF (i.e., pH 7.4) or slightly lower, but preferably not below pH Àú5.5, to allow for optimum stability of the active ingredient, while minimizing possible side effects of non-physiological pH values such as activation of proteolytic enzymes, e.g., cathepsins. The excipients used for IA injection may also be present in other injection formulations, e.g., for intramuscular or subcutaneous application. In an embodiment of the present invention, the mode of administration of the FGF-18 compound described herein is selected from the group consisting of: intra-auricular administration, peri-auricular administration, intra-nasal administration, peri-nasal administration, endosinusial administration, intra-costal administration, peri-costal administration, intra-thoracic administration, peri-thoracic administration, epidural administration, peri-vertebral administration, peri-synovial administration, intra-synovial administration, endosinusial administration, peri-articular administration and intra-articular administration. In a preferred embodiment, the FGF-18 compound described herein is administered peri-articularly (administration around a joint) or intrarticularly (administration within a joint). In an embodiment of the present invention, the periarticular or intraarticular administration is done around or in a joint selected from joint of the hip, knee, elbow, wrist, ankle, spine, feet, finger, toe, hand, shoulder, ribs, shoulder blades, thighs, shins, heels and along the bony points of the spine. In yet another preferred embodiment the periarticular or intraarticular administration is done around or in a the joint of the hip or the knee. Cartilage Disorders The present invention relates to methods of treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of a cartilage disorder in a mammal. Preferably such cartilage disorder result from damages due to traumatic injury or chondropathy. It is understood that preferably humans are patients to be treated according to the present invention; however, it is understood that other mammals, including but not limited to dogs, horses and the like may be treated with methods according to the present invention. Examples of cartilage disorders that may be treated, prevented or ameliorated by the treatment described herein include but are not restricted to: arthritis, osteochondritis, costochondritis (such as Tietze'syndrome), osteomyelitis, polychondritis, relapsing polychondritis and Osteochondritis Dissecans. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is arthritis. Preferably, said disease is selected from the group consisting of: ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), gout, pseudogout, infectious arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, scleroderma, Sj√∂gren's syndrome and Still's disease. In a preferred embodiment, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteoarthritis. Arthritis, relates to a damage to articular structures (joints) in the body and related inflammatory processes. Arthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritic joints as a result of injury, and the like, are common inflammatory conditions which would benefit from the therapeutic use of FGF18 according to the present invention. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is arthritis involving the spine. It causes pain and stiffness in the back, and also a bent posture. This is a result of ongoing swelling and irritation of the spinal joints (vertebrae). In severe cases, inflammation of the vertebrae can eventually cause them to fuse together leading to severely limited mobility. Inflammation of the tendons and ligaments that connect and provide support to joints can lead to pain and tenderness in the ribs, shoulder blades, hips, thighs, shins, heels and along the bony points of the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory form of arthritis that affects the spinal joints. The hallmark feature of AS is the involvement of the joints at the base of the spine where the spine joins the pelvis‚Äîthe sacroiliac (SI) joints. The disease course is highly variable, and while some individuals have episodes of transient back pain only, others have more chronic severe back pain that leads to differing degrees of spinal stiffness over time. In almost all cases the disease is characterized by acute painful episodes and remissions (periods where the problem settles). Over the years AS has been known by many different names including poker back, rheumatoid spondylitis, and Marie-Strumpells spondylitis. Since the early 70s with increasing knowledge about the disease, there is almost universal use of the term ankylosing spondylitis. AS is a member of the family of diseases that attack the spine. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is characterized by excessive bone growth along the sides of the vertebrae of the spine. It also involves inflammation and bone growth where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, such as at the elbow, knee and the heel of the foot. Bone spurs are common among people with DISH. DISH (sometimes called Forestier's disease) is considered a form of degenerative arthritis and is characterized by excessive bone growth along the sides of the vertebrae of the spine. It is also associated with inflammation and calcification (bone growth) at other areas of the body where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, such as at the elbow, knee and the heel of the foot. These can lead to bone spurs. Heel spurs, for example, are common among people with DISH. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is gout. Gout is a type of arthritis in which uric acid, a waste product that occurs naturally occurring within the body, rises above normal levels. Rather than being flushed by the kidneys and through the urine, as it normally is, it forms crystals and deposits in the joints. These deposits give rise to inflammation of the joints, causing pain, swelling, redness and tenderness of the area. Most typically the joint affected is that of the big toe, but gout can also affect the ankle, knee, foot, hand, wrist and elbow. Uric acid crystals may also form deposits in other areas such as under the skin or in other soft tissues, and in the kidney or urinary tract. Gout typically affects the joint at the base of the big toe. In over half of all initial attacks, this is the first joint affected. Almost any other joint can be affected, but the joints of the lower limbs are more commonly than those of the upper limbs. The majority of initial gout attacks involve only one joint, and, with treatment, subside within three to ten days. Over 50% of people who have had an acute attack of gout will have a recurrence within the year. Over time the attacks may become more frequent, longer lasting and often involve more joints. For some people the attacks linger, and the disease becomes chronic. The crystals of uric acid deposited inside the joint and in the surrounding soft tissues lead to destructive changes in the joint and cause persistent inflammation. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is pseudogout. Pseudogout is a type of arthritis that is caused by the build up of calcium in the body. Pseudogout results from a build up of calcium crystals (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) in a joint. The calcium forms crystals that deposit in the joints between bones. This causes swelling and pain in the area. The calcium deposits and chronic inflammation can cause parts of the joint structure to weaken and break down. With pseudogout cartilage can begin to crack and get holes in it and cause more pain and swelling in the joint. Over time the cartilage may wear away entirely, and the bones rub together. Much of the pain of pseudogout is a result of muscles and the other tissues that help joints move (such as tendons and ligaments) being forced to work in ways for which they were not designed, as a result of damage to the cartilage. Cartilage itself does not have nerve cells, and therefore cannot sense pain, but the muscles, tendons, ligaments and bones do. After many years of cartilage erosion, bones may actually rub together. This grinding of bone against bone adds further to the pain. Bones can also thicken and form growths, called spurs or osteophytes, which rub together. Like the disease gout, pseudogout can come on as sudden, recurrent attacks of pain and swelling in a single joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is infectious arthritis. Infectious arthritis causes pain and swelling in the joints. The inflammation is caused by a germ. The germ can be a bacterium, a virus, or a fungus. There is usually only one joint involved, though sometimes two or three joints can become infected. It does not usually last a long time if it is treated early. Mostly, infectious arthritis affects the large joints (shoulders, hips, knees), but smaller joints (fingers, ankles) can also be involved. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It may be caused by the breakdown of cartilage. Bits of cartilage may break off and cause pain and swelling in the joint between bones. Over time the cartilage may wear away entirely, and the bones will rub together. Osteoarthritis can affect any joint but usually concerns hands and weight-bearing joints such as hips, knees, feet, and spine. The disease state of osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex, multi-factorial progressive disease that is non-inflammatory in nature and which is characterized by a general age-related degradation of articular cartilage in the joints. OA is also characterized by chondrocyte activation leading to cell proliferation and apoptosis, protease expression and abnormal matrix production, failed cartilage repair leading to loss of extracellular matrix, matrix calcification and osteophyte formation. The degradation of cartilage and extracellular matrix structures leads to increased friction between the bones and nerves of the affected joints. OA causes varying levels of pain and progressive debilitation in those afflicted with the disease. Current therapies for OA are palliative or surgical. In healthy joints cartilage acts as a shock absorber when weight is put on the joint. The slippery surface of the cartilage allows the bones to move smoothly. When a joint develops osteoarthritis the cartilage gradually becomes rough and thin, and the bone underneath thickens. Although there is usually no swelling in the early stage of the disease, as the arthritis progresses there can be inflammation. Bits of cartilage may break off and float around inside the joint. This disturbs other soft tissues inside the joint and can cause pain and swelling between bones. Over time as the cartilage wears down, the bones may form bumps on their ends. These bumps are called spurs. Or, the cartilage may wear away entirely, and bones may directly come in contact with each other. OA may lead to other problems such as: the muscles that hold the joint in place weaken because they are not being used, over time the joint looses its shape and does not work at all. OA commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as hips, knees, feet and spine. However, non-weight bearing joints such as finger joints and the joint at the base of the thumb may be affected as well. It usually does not affect other joints, except when they have been injured or been put under unusual stress. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease that mainly involves the synovial membrane of multiple joints with resultant injury to the articular cartilage. The pathogenesis is T lymphocyte dependent and is associated with the production of rheumatoid factors, auto-antibodies directed against self IgG, with the resultant formation of immune complexes that attain high levels in joint fluid and blood. These complexes in the joint may induce the marked infiltrate of lymphocytes and monocytes into the synovium and subsequent marked synovial changes; the joint space/fluid is infiltrated by similar cells with the addition of numerous neutrophils. Tissues affected are primarily the joints, often in symmetrical pattern. Inflammatory cells release enzymes that may digest bone and cartilage. As a result of rheumatoid arthritis, the inflamed joint lining, the synovium, can invade and damage bone and cartilage leading to joint deterioration and severe pain amongst other physiologic effects. The involved joint can lose its shape and alignment, resulting in pain and loss of movement. Therefore RA may lead to severe disability and increased mortality. Joint damage can occur even in cases where the pain is not severe. It can happen even in the early stages of the disease. For many people with RA, damage has shown up on X-rays of the hands and feet within two years of the onset of the disease. But it may be too late to treat by the time X-rays discover the problem. Severe damage can lead to permanent joint deformity and disability. Pain and swelling may cause difficulty walking. A variety of cytokines are produced locally in the rheumatoid joints. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 and TNF-alpha, two prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokines, play an important role in the mechanisms involved in synovial inflammation and in progressive joint destruction. Indeed, the administration of TNF-alpha and IL-1 inhibitors in patients with RA has led to a dramatic improvement of clinical and biological signs of inflammation and a reduction of radiological signs of bone erosion and cartilage destruction. However, despite these encouraging results, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to these agents, suggesting that other mediators are also involved in the pathophysiology of arthritis. One important way to distinguish RA from other forms of arthritis is by the pattern of joint involvement. For example, RA affects the wrist and many of the hand joints but usually not the joints that are most distal joints. In RA, the joints tend to be involved in a symmetrical pattern. That is, if the knuckles on the right hand are inflamed, the knuckles on the left hand are likely to be inflamed as well. Other joints commonly affected by RA include the elbows, shoulders, neck, jaw, feet, ankles, knees, and hips. Other than the neck, the spine usually is not directly affected by RA. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a condition that causes swelling and pain in and around the joints. It also causes a scaly rash on the skin. It can affect a number of joints including the fingers, wrists, toes, knees, ankles, elbows and shoulder joints, the spine and joints in the lower back (called sacroiliac joints). Psoriatic arthritis also affects tissues surrounding the joints including tendons and ligaments. It may cause swelling of a whole digit called ‚Äúsausage‚Äù finger or toe. There is also skin inflammation, particularly on the elbows, knees and scalp. Psoriatic arthritis is linked to psoriasis, a disorder causing areas of the skin to become inflamed and be covered with silvery or grey scales. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis refers to pain, stiffness, redness or swelling in a joint resulting from a previous infection. It most often occurs in the joints of the lower limbs (knees, ankles, toes), but can also occur in the upper limbs. Problems may be in the joints only or involve other body systems such as the eyes, skin muscles or tendons. When it affects areas besides the joints, reactive arthritis is then called Reiter's syndrome. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is scleroderma. Scleroderma is a condition where the skin gets thick and hard. There are two main types of scleroderma. One type is localized scleroderma, which affects mainly the skin. It can also involve the muscles and joints. The other type, generalized scleroderma, affects the skin as well as the internal organs, such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The most characteristic feature of scleroderma is the build-up of tough scar-like fibrous tissue in the skin. Less visible changes include damage to the cells lining the walls of small blood vessels. This may in turn damage major organs. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Sj√∂gren's syndrome is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the salivary glands resulting in dry mouth, and the tear glands, resulting in dry eyes. It can also affect other parts of the body including joints, muscles and nerves, organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, stomach and brain, or glands such as the thyroid gland. Sj√∂gren's syndrome can cause complete destruction of any of these areas. Since Sj√∂gren's syndrome can affect the liver and pancreas, there is a greater chance of developing cancer of the lymph tissue. However, this is an unusual and rare result. Sj√∂gren's syndrome can occur in two ways. It is ‚Äòsecondary‚Äô Sj√∂gren's syndrome when it occurs in people who have a rheumatic condition or connective tissue disease such as lupus, scleroderma or polymyositis. It is named ‚Äòprimary‚Äô Sj√∂gren's syndrome when dry eyes and mouth are not associated with a rheumatic condition. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Still's disease. Still's disease is a form of arthritis characterized by high spiking fevers, salmon-coloured rashes and inflammation of the joints. The disease is most common among children, for whom it is commonly referred to as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Still's disease can also occur among adults, although much less commonly than for children. In this case it is referred to as adult-onset Still's disease or AOSD. As disclosed here above, cartilage disorders that may be treated, prevented or ameliorated by the treatment described herein include: Osteochondritis Dissecans, costochondritis (such as Tietze'syndrome), osteomyelitis, and relapsing polychondritis. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Osteochondritis Dissecans. Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a term for osteochondral fracture. An osteochondral fragment may be present in situ, incompletely detached, or completely detached. OCD is a form of osteochondrosis limited to the articular epiphysis. Articular epiphyses fail as a result of compression. Both trauma and ischemia probably are involved in the pathology. Trauma is most likely the primary insult, with ischemia as secondary injury. Trauma may be caused by direct trauma, such as impaction fracture, or repetitive microtrauma, such as excessive normal compressive stress. The knee joint is the most commonly involved site. However, the elbow joint, the ankle joint, tarsal navicular, hip joint, shoulder joint, Glenoid, wrist joint may also be affected. OCD tends to affect young patients. In OCD of the elbow, patient age averages 23 years and ranges from 4-47 years. In the ankle, patient age averages 20 years and ranges from 8-50 years. In the hip, patient age averages 24 years and ranges from 14-39 years. Patients usually report pain at the extremes of motion range. Periarticular edema often is present with slight warmth to the touch. When a lower extremity is involved, patients often limp. Symptoms usually improve with protected immobilization of the joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is costochondritis. Costochondritis is an inflammation of the junctions where the upper ribs join with the cartilage that holds them to the breastbone or sternum. The cause is usually unknown. When the pain of costochondritis is accompanied by swelling it is referred to as Tietze's syndrome. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory process of the bone and its structures secondary to infection with pyogenic organisms. The infection associated with osteomyelitis may be localized or it may spread through the periosteum, cortex, marrow, and cancellous tissue. The bacterial pathogen varies on the basis of the patient's age and the mechanism of infection. Hematogenous osteomyelitis is an infection caused by bacterial seeding from the blood. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is characterized by an acute infection of the bone caused by the seeding of the bacteria within the bone from a remote source. This condition occurs primarily in children. The most common site is the rapidly growing and highly vascular metaphysis of growing bones. The apparent slowing or sludging of blood flow as the vessels make sharp angles at the distal metaphysis predisposes the vessels to thrombosis and the bone itself to localized necrosis and bacterial seeding. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, despite its name, may have a slow clinical development and insidious onset. Direct or contiguous inoculation osteomyelitis is caused by direct contact of the tissue and bacteria during trauma or surgery. Direct inoculation (contiguous-focus) osteomyelitis is an infection in the bone secondary to the inoculation of organisms from direct trauma, spread from a contiguous focus of infection, or sepsis after a surgical procedure. Clinical manifestations of direct inoculation osteomyelitis are more localized than those of hematogenous osteomyelitis and tend to involve multiple organisms. Additional categories include chronic osteomyelitis and osteomyelitis secondary to peripheral vascular disease. Chronic osteomyelitis persists or recurs, regardless of its initial cause and/or mechanism and despite aggressive intervention. Although listed as an etiology, peripheral vascular disease is actually a predisposing factor rather than a true cause of infection. Disease states known to predispose patients to osteomyelitis include diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), IV drug abuse, alcoholism, chronic steroid use, immunosuppression, and chronic joint disease. In addition the presence of a prosthetic orthopedic device is an independent risk factor as is any recent orthopedic surgery or open fracture. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is relapsing polychondritis. Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an uncommon and severe episodic inflammatory condition involving cartilaginous structures, predominantly those of the ear, nose, and laryngotracheobronchial tree. Other affected structures may include the eye, cardiovascular system, peripheral joints, middle ear, and inner ear. The etiology of this disease is unknown; however, the pathogenesis is most likely autoimmune in nature. Evidence for an autoimmune etiology includes its clinical association with other autoimmune disorders, its association with the HLA-DR4 haplotype, pathology findings of infiltrating CD4 T cells and antigen-antibody complexes in the affected cartilage, cellular and humoral responses against collagen type II and other collagen antigens, and the observation that immunosuppressive regimens most often suppress the disease. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is cartilage damage resulting from a trauma. Cartilage injuries can occur as a result of traumatic mechanical destruction. A direct blow or other trauma can injure the cartilage. Cartilage has no direct blood supply, thus it has little capacity to repair itself. The methods of the present invention improve cartilage repair. Therefore in an embodiment of the present invention, cartilage damage resulting from a trauma is resulting from an accident or from surgery. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, cartilage damage resulting from a trauma is resulting from surgery, in particular orthopedic surgery or plastic surgery. Also considered by the present invention is the treatment of sport-related injury or sport-related wear of tissues of the joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is an unaesthetic appearance disorder. In such an embodiment, the method and use of the present invention may be used in association to plastic surgery. Having now fully described this invention, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the same can be performed within a wide range of equivalent parameters, concentrations and conditions without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention and without undue experimentation.

EXAMPLE 1 Disease Models in Animals and Extended Pharmacology In vivo, FGF-18(170AA) was tested in different disease models of OA and damaged cartilage, with significant therapeutic efficacy using an intra-articular (i.a.) dosing. Overall a therapeutically effective dose of 3-40 Œºg i.a. per animal/week was demonstrable in different species (rat, dog). Results from the aforementioned animal models of disease (OA as well as cartilage defects) are summarized below.

Dosing by the i.a. route was initiated 19-21 days after surgery at doses of 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 Œºg (formulated in saline) to determine pharmacodynamic effects related to the dosing regimen. These total doses were administered either as (i) single dose, (ii) once weekly (‚Öì of total dose per injection) for 3 weeks, or (iii) three times weekly for 3 weeks ( 1/9 of total dose per injection). At the conclusion of treatment or after 3 weeks post-treatment, right knees were collected for histopathology evaluation of potential effects. Evaluation of the lesions was performed in 3 different zones: regional differences across the medial tibial plateau were taken into consideration by dividing each section into 3 zones (1‚Äîoutside, 2‚Äîmiddle, 3‚Äîinside). In the surgical OA model, the outside (z1) and middle (z2) thirds are usually most severely affected, and milder changes are present on the inside third (z3). Treatment schedule outline: Experimental Design Animals (5-10/group), housed 2-3/cage, are anesthetized with Isoflurane and the right knee area is prepared for surgery. A skin incision is made over the medial aspect of the knee and the medial collateral ligament is exposed by blunt dissection, and then transected. The medial meniscus is cut through the full thickness to simulate a complete tear. Skin and subcutis are closed with 4-0 Vicryl suture using a subcuticular pattern. Dosing by the intra-articular route is initiated 19-21 days after surgery and is discontinued after a single dose or continued for 3 weeks with intra-articular injections once per week or 3 times per week. Rats are then terminated (g1-16) or allowed to recover for an additional 3 weeks prior to termination (g17-32). Four hours prior to necropsy, all rats are given 50 mg/kg BRDU to label actively proliferating cells. Blood is collected for serum just prior to necropsy and synovial lavage is done on the right knee. At necropsy, the right (operated) knee joint was trimmed of muscle and connective tissue and collected into 10% neutral buffered formalin. The patella is removed to allow proper fixation of the joints. Trachea, sternum, and ear samples are also placed in formalin. Results Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery Untreated Controls (Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery) Untreated animals with medial meniscal tear that were terminated at 6 weeks post surgery had tibial cartilage degeneration which was most severe on the outer ‚Öî of the tibial plateau and less severe on the inside ‚Öì. Osteophytes were large (mean 468 Œºm). Femoral cartilage degeneration was milder and more variable than tibial degeneration. Animals treated with saline once weekly had a significantly lower zone 3 total of tibial cartilage degeneration scores (16%), a significantly lower depth ratio (16%), and a significantly greater area of viable cartilage in the lateral tibia as compared to untreated animals (13%). Animals treated with saline 3 times weekly had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores in zone 2 of the tibia (24%), a significantly lower depth ratio (13%), and significantly greater area of viable cartilage in both the medial and lateral tibia (15 and 14%). These differences in the control groups are likely a result of repeated anesthesia events influencing overall activity of the animals, although the possibility that repeated saline injections influenced lesion severity by facilitating removal of mediators and debris cannot be ruled out. Single Dose Treatment (Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery) Animals given a single dose of 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had a significantly greater width of total cartilage degeneration (16%) due to an increase in proteoglycan loss in zone 3. Osteophyte scores and measurements were significantly increased (19 and 25%, respectively) in animals given a single dose of 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage matrix in the medial tibia was significantly increased by 27% in animals treated with 10 Œºg. Immunostaining revealed bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) immunopositivity in fibrotic marrow subjacent to cartilage lesions and in bone marrow cells, fibroblasts, and osteophyte cartilage, with similar staining patterns in saline and FGF-18(170AA) treated joints. These results indicate that a single injection of 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had a definite anabolic effect, as evidenced by increased osteophyte size and increased medial tibial cartilage area. These changes were not, however, sufficient to improve the overall cartilage degeneration scores. It is likely that the increase in medial cartilage area is a result of increased cartilage thickness on the load bearing surface adjacent to the osteophyte. Once Weekly for 3 Weeks (Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery) Animals treated with 3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) once weekly had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores compared to the saline once weekly control in zone 2 of the medial tibia. Animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had significantly lower significant degeneration width (37%), and those given 3 Œºg (28%) or 1 Œºg (15%) also had some inhibition. Osteophyte scores and measurements were dose responsively and significantly increased by treatment with 10 (32 and 53%) or 3 (21 and 32%) Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage matrix in the medial tibia was significantly increased by treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (27%). Mild to marked chronic active synovitis with fibrosis was evident in joints injected with 10 or 3 Œºg and those injected with 1 Œºg had minimal synovitis. Subchondral bone resorption was minimally increased in a few joints treated with 10 Œºg. Animals treated with 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had increased BRDU labeling in the fibrotic marrow, synovium, and in areas of chondrogenesis or osteophytes, as compared to saline controls. These results demonstrated dose responsive benefit of treatment using the once weekly paradigm on the significant cartilage degeneration width. This parameter is most indicative of the presence of a viable matrix of some type within the defect area and, along with medial tibial cartilage areas, demonstrates the anabolic response. The BRDU labeling results indicate continued proliferative responses after cessation of dosing. Three Times Weekly for 3 Weeks (Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery) Treatment with 1, 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) administered as 3 injections per week resulted in a significant decrease in tibial cartilage degeneration scores compared to the 3 times weekly saline control in zone 1 (animals treated with 10 Œºg), zone 2 (1 or 3 Œºg), and the zone 3 total (1 or 3 Œºg). Treatment with 10 Œºg significantly increased the total tibial cartilage degeneration width by 24%. Treatment with 1 or 3 Œºg nonsignificantly decreased cartilage degeneration width by 24% and 21% respectively, indicating some beneficial effect. Animals treated with 1 or 3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) also had significantly lower depth ratios (17% and 18% respectively) than saline controls. The medial tibial osteophyte score was increased after treatment with 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (13%, 7%, 13% and 15% respectively), while all 4 doses (0.3, 1, 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA)) significantly increased the osteophyte measurement (12, 18, 60 and 62%, respectively. Treatment with 10 Œºg significantly increased the femoral cartilage degeneration score by 114%. Bone scores were significantly increased by treatment with 3 (60%) or 10 (88%) Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The total joint score without femur was significantly decreased by treatment with 3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (13%), but the addition of the femur to the total joint score eliminated that variation. Treatment with 1, 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased the area of viable cartilage in the medial tibia (13%, 29% and 29%), and treatment with 3 or 10 Œºg significantly increased area in the lateral tibia (22% and 13%). Joints injected with 3 or 10 Œºg had marked to severe synovitis with increased subchondral bone resorption and similar but mild to moderate changes were observed in joints treated with 1 Œºg. Animals treated with 1, 30 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had BRDU labeling in numerous areas including marrow, osteophytes, meniscus, synovium, and areas of chondrogenesis. These results demonstrated the most pronounced anabolic effects of any treatment paradigm, but were accompanied by severe synovial inflammation and increased subchondral bone resorption. Results Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery Untreated Controls (Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery) Untreated animals with medial meniscal tear that were terminated at 9 weeks had tibial cartilage degeneration which was most severe on the outer ‚Öî of the tibial plateau and less severe on the inside ‚Öì. Femoral cartilage degeneration was less severe and more variable. Scores were, in general, higher than in untreated animals terminated at week 6. Single dose saline controls had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores in zone 2 of the tibia (12%) than those of the once weekly saline controls (18%). Single dose saline controls also had significantly greater width of moderate collagen degeneration (92%). Animals given saline once weekly had a significantly lower sum of severe, marked, moderate, and mild collagen degeneration (15%), as those of the 3 times weekly saline control animals (22%). These differences were relatively minor since there were only 5 rats in each of these groups and were a result of variation in disease progression in individuals. Single Dose (Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery, Incl. 3 Weeks Post-Treatment) There was no significant effect of treatment in any animals given a single dose of FGF-18(170AA) and terminated 9 weeks after surgery, although a few joints injected with 10 Œºg had evidence of anabolic response on the lateral tibia. Once Weekly for 3 Weeks (Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery, Incl. 3 Weeks Post-Treatment) After treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) once weekly, significant decreases in cartilage degeneration scores in zone 1 and zone 3 total of the medial tibia by 38 and 31% were observed. Treatment with 0.3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly reduced scores in zone 2 compared to the once weekly saline control. Animals treated with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had significantly lower significant cartilage degeneration width (38%). Depth ratios were significantly decreased by treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (22%). Treatment with 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly and identically increased osteophyte scores (25%), but only animals given 10 Œºg had significantly increased osteophyte measurements (53%). There was a 23% significant decrease in total joint score with femur in animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage was significantly increased in animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) in both the medial (40%) and lateral (81%) tibia. Treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly reduced the width of severe and minimal collagen degeneration, as well as the width of severe, marked, and moderated degeneration combined and the width of severe and marked combined. Synovial inflammation was minimal in joints injected with 3 or 10 Œºg and absent at lower doses. Anabolic responses were evident in some or all joints injected with any dose. BRDU labeling was seen mainly in bone marrow and fibroblasts of saline controls and increased labeling (cartilage and osteophytes) was seen in joints injected with 10 Œºg. These results indicated that the cartilage repair/anabolic responses continued beyond the treatment period and that synovitis subsided, although osteophyte measures were comparable at 6 or 9 weeks in joints treated with this dose. Dose responsive benefit was seen using the significant cartilage degeneration parameter and severe matrix loss, as measured by collagen degeneration, was improved. Three Times Weekly for 3 Weeks (Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery, Incl. 3 Weeks Post-Treatment) The zone 3 total tibial cartilage degeneration score was significantly decreased by 38% in animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) as 3 injections weekly, as compared to the 3 times weekly saline control. Treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) also significantly decreased the significant cartilage degeneration width (48%). The depth ratio was significantly decreased by 27% in animals treated with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA). Osteophyte measurements were significantly increased in animals treated with 3 (57%) or 10 (103%) Œºg FGF-18(170AA). Treatment with 1, 3, or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased the area of viable cartilage in the medial tibia (34%, 37% and 71% respectively), while treatment with 0.3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased areas in the lateral tibia (46% and 67%). Mild collagen degeneration width was significantly increased in animals treated with 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA), as was the width of mild and minimal degeneration combined in animals given 10 Œºg. Mild synovitis was present in all joints injected with 10 Œºg (divided) and minimal to mild synovitis was present in those given 1 or 3 Œºg. Anabolic responses were evident from 1 Œºg upwards. BRDU labeling was seen mainly in bone marrow and fibroblasts of saline controls and increased labeling (cartilage and osteophytes) was seen in joints injected with 10 Œºg. These results indicated that the cartilage repair/anabolic responses continued beyond the treatment period and that synovitis subsided as compared to the 6 week time point. Beneficial effects on collagen loss were less clear, although there was a definite trend towards smaller measurements for the areas of marked to severe loss. EXAMPLE 1.2 Dog Menisectomy Model of OA Female beagle dogs (n=3/group) that had had unilateral partial medial menisectomy on the left knee one month prior to initiation of treatment were treated with saline or 3, 10, or 30 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) once, once weekly, or three times weekly (divided ‚Öì doses) for 3 weeks to determine beneficial effects on established OA. After 3 weeks of treatment, left knees were evaluated for effects on gross (n=3/group) and microscopic (n=3/group) changes induced by menisectomy and for evidence of anabolic effects. All dogs except one exhibited normal appetite and activity throughout the study. One dog (YLI-8) from group 12 died prior to termination (day 17) due to aspiration pneumonia associated with repeated anesthesia for joint injections. Typical degenerative changes characterized by the presence of focal, well circumscribed lesions of cartilage degeneration were present on the medial tibias of all operated dogs in all groups. Femoral lesions were sporadically observed. All dogs had minimal medial joint capsule thickening. Meniscal damage (approximately ¬Ω absent at necropsy with generally none to moderate repair) was similar in all groups. Microscopic evaluation revealed that untreated and vehicle treated knees often had cartilage hypertrophy with cloning in the zone 1 of levels 1 and 2. Definite anabolic effects (increased cloning, cellularity, and proteoglycan staining in lesion areas) were observed in knees treated with 30 Œºg (10 Œºg three times weekly) FGF-18(170AA), and these changes were most identifiable on femoral condyles. Lesser, but still convincing anabolic effects were observed in some knees treated 3 times weekly with the lower doses of FGF-18(170AA), or in knees treated with 30 or 10 Œºg once weekly. When present, these FGF-18(170AA) induced changes were generally in the upper ‚Öì to ¬Ω of the cartilage or in matrix adjacent to deeper clefts. Results of this study demonstrated definite anabolic effects of i.a. treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) 3 times weekly (30 Œºg total/week) in all knees and lesser effects in some knees treated with lower doses 3 times weekly or with 30 or 10 Œºg once weekly. The changes consisted of cloning, increased proteoglycan synthesis in the upper ‚Öì to ¬Ω of the cartilage or in matrix adjacent to clefts. Mild marginal zone proliferative changes were observed in some joints but there were no excessive changes similar to those occurring in rats. The anabolic changes in articular cartilage were greater than the anabolic changes in marginal zones in all cases. Collagen damage measurements also suggested some protection of matrix integrity. EXAMPLE 1.3 Dog Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Model For investigations on severe progressive osteoarthritis, the dog anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) model is used for pre-clinical pharmacology investigations, including MRI evaluation at end of treatment and at follow up. This model provides efficacy data (histopathological and MRI over time and follow up) together with data on function by means of gait analysis. Using a non-invasive read-out MRI already at end of treatment a decrease in cartilage lesions compared to healthy baseline was demonstrable (‚àí13.3, ‚àí7.5, ‚àí9.3 and ‚àí8.8 for vehicle, 3 Œºg/joint, 10 Œºg/joint and 30 Œºg/joint, respectively). Also a functional improvement measured via gait analysis on force plate is demonstrable at end of therapy: Gait analysis was performed using a platform-based pressure/force measurement (Matscan¬Æ System, Tekscan Inc, Boston, Mass., USA). Gait Acquisition Procedures The Matscan¬Æ System comprises 4 walkway floor displays, each having 2,288 sensing elements included in a sensing area of 432 mm√ó368 mm, producing a spatial resolution of 1.4 sensels/cm2. This device was calibrated with a predefined weight at the beginning of the study and the same calibration was used for all dogs throughout the study. For the osteoarthritis-induced hind limb, the peak vertical force and the contact area were acquired at a trotting gait velocity ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 meters/second. Velocity was ensured using a chronometer. The gait acquisition window was 3 seconds with a sampling rate set at 44 hertz, producing a total of 132 frames. The first 5 valid trials were obtained for each dog and then averaged to characterize the dog profile at a given point in time. The peak vertical force was expressed in percentage of body weight (% BW) and the contact area was expressed in square centimeters (cm2). With regard to the peak vertical force of the osteoarthritis-induced hind limb acquired at the trot, the canine osteoarthritis model produced an abnormal gait (week 4) discernable over pre-operative values (baseline). The peak vertical force and the contact area were decreased 4 and 8 weeks following surgery as negative changes were observed in all groups (Tables 3 & 4). There was however a trend for dogs in Group IV at 8 weeks following surgery to have a less severe decrease compared to baseline vis-√†-vis the other groups.

Overall, the results indicated that the total radioactivity distributed outside the synovial fluid into the tissues of the knee articulation. The results obtained after autoradioluminography analysis of the treated knee joints shown that most of the radioactivity was localized in close proximity to the articulation. The results of whole body autoradioluminography analyses after intravenous administration and intra-articular administration of [ 3 H]-FGF18 are reported in table 8 and in table 9, respectively.

The measured half live in serum was about 55 hours. After intra-articular administration the means of total radioactivity increased slowly reaching the highest concentration at 24 and 48 hours after administration, in serum and blood, respectively. The systemic exposure was approximately 20% of that found after intravenous administration. Total radioactivity in serum was on average higher than that in blood, suggesting that the parent compound and/or its metabolites had low affinity for blood cells and circulating radioactivity was mainly distributed in serum. The levels of total radioactivity in the treated articulation declined bi-phasically with a terminal half-life of 20 hours. Overall, the results indicated that the total radioactivity distributed outside the synovial fluid into the knee articulation. Overall, based on the non-clinical pharmacology models in rat and dog, it is found that a particularly appropriate dosing regimen is once weekly for three weeks. The effective dose observed varies from 3-30 Œºg/joint.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is in the field of medicine and concerns the treatment of cartilage disorders and osteoarthritis in particular. More specifically, it relates to the use of FGF-18 in treatment regimens and for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of patients having a cartilage disorder such as osteoarthritis, such as for example knee osteoarthritis or secondary hip osteoarthritis. Specifically provided is a preferred treatment scheme comprising once weekly administration of an FGF-18 compound per treatment cycle. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FGF18 was identified as a member of the FGF family which was most closely related to FGF8 and FGF17. Activities associated with FGF18 include stimulation of mesenchymal lineage cells, in particular cardiac myocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes (U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,971). FGF18 binds and activates FGFR4 and the IIIc splice variant of FGFR3 and FGFR2. Bone remodeling is the dynamic process by which tissue mass and skeletal architecture are maintained. The process is a balance between bone resorption and bone formation, with two cell types thought to be the major players. These cells are the osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts synthesize and deposit matrix to become new bone. The activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are regulated by many factors, systemic and local, including growth factors. Cartilage is a type of dense connective tissue. It is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are dispersed in a firm, gel-like ground substance, called the matrix. Cartilage is avascular (contains no blood vessels) and nutrients are diffused through the matrix. Cartilage is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, in the throat and between intervertebral disks. There are three main types of cartilage: hyaline, elastic and fibrocartilage. The main purpose of cartilage is to provide a framework upon which bone deposition could begin. Another important purpose of cartilage is to provide smooth surfaces and mechanical protection for the movement of articulating bones. Replacement of damaged cartilage, in particular articular cartilage, caused either by injury or disease is a major challenge for physicians, and available treatments are considered unpredictable and effective for only a limited time. Virtually all currently available treatments for cartilage damage focus on pain relief, with little or no efficacy on regeneration of damaged tissues. Therefore, the majority of younger patients either do not seek treatment or are counseled to postpone treatment for as long as possible. When treatment is required, the standard procedure is total joint replacement or microfracture, a procedure that involves penetration of the subchondral bone to stimulate fibrocartilage deposition by chondrocytes. For patients with osteoarthritis, non-surgical treatment consists of physical therapy, lifestyle modification (e.g. reducing activity), bracing, supportive devices, oral and injection drugs (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and medical management. Surgical options are very specific to osteoarthritis severity and can provide a reduction in symptoms that are generally only short lived. Tibial or femoral osteotomics (cutting the bone to rebalance joint wear) may reduce symptoms, help to maintain an active lifestyle, and delay the need for total joint replacement. Total joint replacement can provide relief for the symptom of advanced osteoarthritis, but generally requires a change in a patient's lifestyle and/or activity level. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a method for treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of cartilage disorders that would permit regeneration of damaged tissue. In addition, it would be desirable that such method be as safe and effective as possible. Moreover, as cartilage disorders may be chronic diseases, it would be desirable that such method permits re-treatments of the patient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for treating a patient having a cartilage disorder comprising the administration of an FGF-18 compound wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the cartilage disorder to be treated is osteoarthritis, the FGF-18 compound is the FGF-18 fragment designated herein as FGF-18(170AA) and the posology cycle is 10 to 30 mcg per intra-articular injection once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (one treatment cycle). In a preferred embodiment such treatment cycles may be repeated after 4 or 6 months. For example, where a treatment cycle is repeated after 6 months, if a first treatment cycle is started e.g. in January of a given year, then a second treatment cycle may be started in July of said year. Further provided herein is the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. Also provided herein is the use of an FGF-18 compound for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. Provided herein is also the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder, the medicament being adapted to be administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURE FIG. 1 is a treatment regimen for evaluating the effects of FGF-18 on cartilage and injuries. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides suitable treatment modalities, including suitable administration schemes for the treatment of various cartilage disorders, such as in particular osteoarthritis, with FGF-18 compounds, such as for example the FGF-18(170AA) protein fragment. In the context of the present invention it has been surprisingly found that FGF-18 compounds have optimal disease- or symptom-ameliorating effects on cartilage disorders when administered according to the methods and uses disclosed herein. It has been found that less frequent dosing schedules than contemplated by the present invention may not be fully effective, whereas more frequent dosing than contemplated by the present invention may cause inflammation and/or other counterproductive effects on the cartilage or joint environment when the same or comparable dosages as those contemplated by the present invention are being used. Accordingly, in one aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for treating a patient having a cartilage disorder comprising the administration of an FGF-18 compound wherein the FGF-18 compound is administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. For example, where administrations are separated by about 4 days, a second administration may be made about 96 hours after a first administration; e.g. where and administration is given on day 1 in, for example, the morning, there will be 3 calendar days where the patient will not receive an administration (day 2, day 3, day 4) and the patient will again receive an administration on day 5 in the morning. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by about 7 days.

In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by about 7 days. In a preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about 7 days each. Preferably, the FGF-18 compound is administered in regular intervals once per week. In an embodiment of the present invention there is provided the use of an FGF-18 compound in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a patient having a cartilage disorder the medicament being adapted to be administered at least two times, said administrations being separated by about 4, preferably 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 days. In a particularly preferred embodiment said administrations are separated by about, 6, 7 or 8 days. In one preferred embodiment they are separated by about 7 days.

In a preferred embodiment the treatment comprises administration at a dose of 80, 90, 100, 110 or 120 mcg/kg per single intravenous administration of the FGF-18 compound. In a preferred embodiment the cartilage disorder treated by any of the methods of the invention is osteoarthritis, such as for example osteoarthritis which is classified as stage II or stage III according to OARSI. In a preferred example the osteoarthritis may be knee osteoarthritis or hip osteoarthritis, such as secondary hip osteoarthritis. The skilled person is fully aware of osteoarthritis classifications that are used in the art. In particular, the OARSI classification is known in the art. The skilled person may reference the ‚ÄúGuidelines for the medical management of osteoarthritis‚Äù (Marc C. Hochberg, Roy D. Altman, Kenneth D. Brandt, Bruce M. Clark, Paul A. Dieppe, Marie R. Griffin, Roland W. Moskowitz, Thomas J. Schnitzer, Arthritis & Rheumatism, Volume 38, Issue 11, 1995. Pages 1535-1546.) Preferred FGF-18 compounds of the invention are selected from human wildtype FGF-18 or FGF-18(170AA). Compounds of the Invention Native or wildtype FGF-18 is a protein expressed by chondrocytes of articular cartilage. The present invention generally relates to the use of an Fibroblast Growth Factor 18 (FGF-18) compound in the treatment of osteoarthritis. An FGF-18 compound of the invention includes for example native or wildtype FGF-18, in particular human FGF-18, bioactive variants thereof, such as bioactive allelic variants, and bioactive truncated forms of FGF-18. The present invention may relate to any variant or modified from of FGF-18 which retains the desired FGF-18 bioactivity as herein described, such as in particular the increase in cartilage deposition. Bioactivities of FGF-18 include in particular those described in the Examples hereinbelow, such as in particular in the in vivo disease models described herein. The nucleotide sequence of the human FGF-18 cDNA is described in SEQ ID NO. 1, and its deduced amino acid sequence is described in SEQ ID NO. 2. FGF18 was originally designated zFGF-5, and is fully described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,352,971, 5,989,866 and US Patent Application Publication US2005/0043234, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Analysis of the cDNA encoding a human FGF18 polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 1) revealed an open reading frame encoding 207 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 2) comprising a mature polypeptide of 180 amino acids (residue 28 to residue 207 of SEQ ID NO: 2). The mouse FGF-18 polynucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3 and corresponding amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 were found to have a high degree of homology to that of the human ortholog. At the amino acid level, the mouse and human polypeptides are approximately 98% identical, with three amino acid changes. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the sequences disclosed in SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4 represent a single allele of the human and mouse FGF18 gene and polypeptide, respectively, and that allelic variation and alternative splicing are expected to occur. As already mentioned, FGF-18 compound of the invention includes for example native or wildtype FGF-18, in particular human FGF-18, bioactive variants thereof, such as bioactive allelic variants, and bioactive truncated forms of FGF-18. The present invention may relate to any variant or modified from of FGF-18 which retains the desired FGF-18 bioactivity as herein described, such as in particular the increase in cartilage deposition. In an embodiment of the present invention FGF-18 compound is a truncated form of human FGF-18. In a particular embodiment said truncated form of FGF-18 comprises or consists of residues 28 to 175 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a functional derivative, or variant or mutein as defined herein. In another embodiment said truncated form of FGF-18 comprises or consists of residues 28 to 176, 28 to 177, 28 to 178, 28 to 179, 28 to 180, 28 to 181, 28 to 182, 28 to 183, 28 to 184, 28 to 185, 28 to 186, 28 to 187, 28 to 188, 28 to 189, 28 to 190, 28 to 191, 28 to 192, 28 to 193, 28 to 194 or 28 to 195, 28 to 196, 28 to 197, 28 to 198, 28 to 199, 28 to 200, 28 to 201, 28 to 202, 28 to 203, 28 to 204, 28 to 205, 28 to 206 or 28 to 207 of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a functional derivative, or a variant or mutein as defined herein. These polypeptides, functional derivative, or variant or mutein may comprise an additional N-terminal amino acid residue, preferably a methionine. Indeed, depending on the expression system and conditions, polypeptides of the invention may be expressed in a recombinant host cell with a starting Methionine. A preferred embodiment of the present invention is a truncated form of FGF-18, containing 170 amino acids (AA), hereinafter also designated as ‚ÄúFGF-18(170AA)‚Äù. The wild type or naturally occurring form is 207 AA long of which the first 27 AA are the signal sequence and the last 11 AA are deleted in FGF-18(170AA) (as can be demonstrated also for natural occurring FGF-18 in vivo). FGF-18(170AA) may be expressed in E. coli , as there is no signal sequence and the AA sequence starts with a methionine followed by AA28 and ends with AA196. The molecular weight of FGF-18(170AA) is 19.83 kDa, plÀú10. FGF-18(170AA) is further described in SEQ ID NO. 5 hereinbelow. FGF-18(170AA) increases chondrocyte proliferation/differentiation and cartilage deposition leading to repair and reconstruction for a variety of cartilaginous tissues. Members of the FGF family are characterized by heparin binding domains. A putative heparin-binding domain for FGF-18 has been identified in the region of amino acid residue 148 (Gly) to amino acid residue 169 (Gln) of SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4. It is postulated that receptor-mediated signaling is initiated upon binding of FGF ligand complexed with cell-surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans. Many FGF family members can be placed into one of two related families on the basis of their structures and functions. aFGF and bFGF consist of three exons separated by two introns of variable length. FGF-18 consists of five exons, the first three of which correspond to the first exon of aFGF and bFGF. All known FGF family members are spliced to form single polypeptides. Analysis of the ligand-receptor complex of FGF-18 has demonstrated that FGF18 has specificity for FGFR4 and the ‚ÄúIIIc‚Äù splice variants of FGFR3 and FGFR2. FGFR3-IIIc and FGFR2-IIIc are expressed by chondrocytes of cartilage tissue, and in particular, both receptors have been found within human articular cartilage. FGFR3 and FGFR2 have been found in the growth plate of mammals and play important roles in the formation of endochondral and intramembranous bone. FGFR2 is first expressed in condensing mesenchyme and FGFR3 expression is initiated as chondrocytes differentiate and proliferate. In developing cranial bones, FGFR3 is found in the dura mater and periosteum, whereas FGFR2 is expressed in osteoprogenitor cells at the osteogenic front separating the sutures. FGFR2 is also expressed in traebecular bone. Previously, it has been shown that FGF18 is a proliferative agent for chondrocytes and osteoblasts, depending upon both the differentiated state of these cell types and the mode of administration. (See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,352,971 and 5,989,866; Ellsworth et al. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage, 10: 308-320, 2002; Shimoaka et al. , J. Bio. Chem. 277 (9) 7493-500, 2002). Preferably, the FGF-18 compound of the invention increases cartilage deposition. Such increase may be measured both in vivo and in vitro. Generation of hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage are valuable both as a therapeutic and as component for biological matrices. FGF-18 compounds, such as FGF-18(170AA), and compositions containing FGF-18 compounds (‚ÄúFGF-18 compositions‚Äù) will be useful in treating articular cartilage defects in synovial joints that are due to age-related superficial fibrillation, cartilage degeneration due to osteoarthritis, and focal chondral and osteochondral defects due to injury or disease. FGF-18 compounds and compositions may also be useful for treating joint disease caused by osteochondritis dissecans and degenerative joint disease. In the field of reconstructive and plastic surgery, FGF-18 compositions will be useful for autogenous or allogenic cartilage expansion and transfer for reconstruction of extensive tissue defects. FGF-18 compounds and compositions may also be useful to expand cells and induce elastic cartilage production. Expansions of cells and induction of elastic cartilage production will be useful for generation and repair of ear and nose tissue. FGF-18 compounds and compositions can also be used to expand chondrocyte populations in culture for autogenous or allogenic chondrocyte transplantation and then administered with or without concurrent treatment consisting of administration of FGF-18 compositions. In these procedures, for example, chondrocytes can be harvested arthroscopically from an uninjured minor load-bearing area of the damaged joint, and can be cultured in the presence of FGF18 compositions to increase the number of cells prior to transplantation. The expanded cultures will then be admixed with FGF-18 compositions, and placed in the joint space or directly into the defect. FGF-18 compositions can be used in combination with periosteal or perichondrial grafts that contain cells that can form cartilage and/or help to hold the transplanted chondrocytes or their precursor cells in place. FGF-18 compositions can be used to repair cartilage damage in conjunction with lavage of the joint, stimulation of bone marrow, abrasion arthroplasty, subchondral drilling, or microfracture of the subchondral bone. Additionally, after the growth of cartilage due to the administration of the FGF-18 composition, additional surgical treatment may be necessary to suitably contour the newly formed cartilage surface. An FGF-18 compound according to the present invention may also be a functional derivative, variant or mutein of a wildtype FGF-18 protein. ‚ÄúFunctional derivatives‚Äù as used herein cover derivatives of FGF-18, and its variants or muteins and fused proteins, which may be prepared from the functional groups which occur as side chains on the residues or the N or C terminal groups, by means known in the art. These functional derivatives are included in the invention as long as they remain pharmaceutically acceptable, i.e. they do not destroy the activity of the protein, which is substantially similar to, or better than, the activity of FGF-18, and do not confer toxic properties on compositions containing it. These derivatives may, for example, include polyethylene glycol side chains, which may improve other properties of the protein, such as stability, half-life, bioavailability, tolerance by the human body, or reduce immunogenicity. To achieve this goal, FGF-18 may be linked e.g. to Polyethlyenglycol (PEG). PEGylation may be carried out by known methods, as for example described in WO 92/13095. In particular, PEG-IFN can be prepared in accordance with the teaching of WO 99/55377. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the functional derivative of FGF-18 comprises at least one moiety attached to one or more functional groups, which occur as one or more side chains on the amino acid residues. An embodiment in which the moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety is highly preferred. In accordance with the present invention, several PEG moieties may also be attached to the FGF-18. Other derivatives include a modified FGF-18 protein, such as a long-acting form of FGF-18. In particular, the long-acting FGF-18 may be selected from pegylated FGF-18, FGF-18-HAS fusion proteins, and FGF-18-Fc-fusion proteins. Other derivatives include aliphatic esters of the carboxyl groups, amides of the carboxyl groups by reaction with ammonia or with primary or secondary amines, N-acyl derivatives of free amino groups of the amino acid residues formed with acyl moieties (e.g. alkanoyl or carbocyclic aroyl groups) or O-acyl derivatives of free hydroxyl groups (for example that of seryl or threonyl residues) formed with acyl moieties. ‚ÄúVariants‚Äù or ‚Äúmuteins‚Äù, as used in the frame of the present invention, refer to analogs of FGF-18, in which one or more of the amino acid residues of natural FGF-18 are replaced by different amino acid residues, or are deleted, or one or more amino acid residues are added to the natural sequence of FGF-18, without diminishing considerably the activity of the resulting products as compared with the wild type FGF-18. These muteins are prepared by known synthesis and/or by site-directed mutagenesis techniques, or any other known technique suitable therefor. The ‚Äúvariant‚Äù or ‚Äúmutein‚Äù in accordance with the present invention include proteins encoded by a nucleic acid, such as DNA or RNA, which hybridizes to DNA or RNA encoding FGF-18 as disclosed e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 5,989,866 under stringent conditions. The term ‚Äústringent conditions‚Äù refers to hybridization and subsequent washing conditions, which those of ordinary skill in the art conventionally refer to as ‚Äústringent‚Äù.

Without limitation, examples of stringent conditions include washing conditions 12-20¬∞ C. below the calculated Tm of the hybrid under study in, e.g., 2√óSSC and 0.5% SDS for 5 minutes, 2√óSSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 minutes; 0.1√óSSC and 0.5% SDS at 37¬∞ C. for 30 60 minutes and then, a 0.1√óSSC and 0.5% SDS at 68¬∞ C. for 30-60 minutes. Those of ordinary skill in this art understand that stringency conditions also depend on the length of the DNA sequences, oligonucleotide probes (such as 10-40 bases) or mixed oligonucleotide probes. If mixed probes are used, it is preferable to use tetramethyl ammonium chloride (TMAC) instead of SSC. See Ausubel, supra. Identity reflects a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, determined by comparing the sequences. In general, identity refers to an exact nucleotide to nucleotide or amino acid to amino acid correspondence of the two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences, respectively, over the length of the sequences being compared. For sequences where there is not an exact correspondence, a ‚Äú% identity‚Äù may be determined. In general, the two sequences to be compared are aligned to give a maximum correlation between the sequences. This may include inserting ‚Äúgaps‚Äù in either one or both sequences, to enhance the degree of alignment. A % identity may be determined over the whole length of each of the sequences being compared (so-called global alignment), that is particularly suitable for sequences of the same or very similar length, or over shorter, defined lengths (so-called local alignment), that is more suitable for sequences of unequal length. Methods for comparing the identity and homology and/or similarity of two or more sequences are well known in the art. Thus for instance, programs available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, version 9.1 (Devereux J et al., 1984), for example the programs BESTFIT and GAP, may be used to determine the % identity between two polynucleotides and the % identity and the % homology between two polypeptide sequences. BESTFIT uses the ‚Äúlocal homology‚Äù algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981) and finds the best single region of similarity between two sequences. Other programs for determining identity and/or similarity between sequences are also known in the art, for instance the BLAST family of programs (Altschul S F et al, 1990, Altschul S F et al, 1997, accessible through the home page of the NCBI at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and FASTA (Pearson W R, 1990). The ‚Äúvariant‚Äù or ‚Äúmutein‚Äù in accordance with the present invention include proteins having a sequence of amino acids sufficiently duplicative of that of FGF-18, such as to have substantially similar activity to FGF-18. In a preferred embodiment, any such variant or mutein has at least 40% identity or homology with the sequence of FGF-18. More preferably, it has at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80% or, most preferably, at least 90% identity or homology thereto. Muteins of FGF-18, which can be used in accordance with the present invention, or nucleic acid coding thereof, include a finite set of substantially corresponding sequences as substitution peptides or polynucleotides which can be routinely obtained by one of ordinary skill in the art, without undue experimentation, based on the teachings and guidance presented herein. Preferred changes for muteins in accordance with the present invention are what are known as ‚Äúconservative‚Äù substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions of FGF-18 polypeptides may include synonymous amino acids within a group which have sufficiently similar physicochemical properties that substitution between members of the group will preserve the biological function of the molecule (Grantham, 1974). It is clear that insertions and deletions of amino acids may also be made in the above-defined sequences without altering their function, particularly if the insertions or deletions only involve a few amino acids, e.g., under thirty, and preferably under ten, and do not remove or displace amino acids which are critical to a functional conformation, e.g., cysteine residues. Proteins and muteins produced by such deletions and/or insertions come within the purview of the present invention. Preferably, the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table A. More preferably, the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table B; and most preferably the synonymous amino acid groups are those defined in Table C.

Formulation of an FGF18-Compound and Administration FGF-18 compounds may be formulated as a pharmaceutical composition, i.e. together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or the like. The definition of ‚Äúpharmaceutically acceptable‚Äù is meant to encompass any carrier, which does not interfere with effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient and that is not toxic to the host to which it is administered. For example, for parenteral administration, the active protein(s) may be formulated in a unit dosage form for injection in vehicles such as saline, dextrose solution, serum albumin and Ringer's solution. Such formulations of FGF-18 compounds including at least one further pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipients or the like are herein also referred to as ‚ÄúFGF-18 compositions‚Äù. FGF-18 compounds and compositions can be applied by direct injection into the synovial fluid of the joint or directly into the defect, either alone or complexed with a suitable carrier for extended release of protein (such as for example suitable excipients for slow-release formulations, such as e.g. cyclodextrin) or restricted local release (such as, for example, delivery through biocompatible sponges, similar bio-matrixes, encapsulated cells or the like). Formulations for intraarticular (IA) application will comply with most of the requirements that also apply to other injection formulations, i.e., they need to be sterile and compatible with the physiological conditions at the application site (e.g., knee joint, SF). The sterility of solution formulations can be achieved by autoclaving (if all components of the formulation are sufficiently resistant to thermal stress) or sterile filtration, while for other formulations, the manufacturing processes required for ensuring a sterile product may be more complex. For example, sterile filtration is not feasible for formulations containing particles (suspensions), semi-solid or solid formulations. For compatibility of the formulation with the physiological conditions at the site of injection, the characteristics of the SF have to be taken into consideration. Preferably formulations of the invention therefore are isotonic. The pH of the formulations is either close to the pH of SF (i.e., pH 7.4) or slightly lower, but preferably not below pH Àú5.5, to allow for optimum stability of the active ingredient, while minimizing possible side effects of non-physiological pH values such as activation of proteolytic enzymes, e.g., cathepsins. The excipients used for IA injection may also be present in other injection formulations, e.g., for intramuscular or subcutaneous application. In an embodiment of the present invention, the mode of administration of the FGF-18 compound described herein is selected from the group consisting of: intra-auricular administration, peri-auricular administration, intra-nasal administration, peri-nasal administration, endosinusial administration, intra-costal administration, peri-costal administration, intra-thoracic administration, peri-thoracic administration, epidural administration, peri-vertebral administration, peri-synovial administration, intra-synovial administration, endosinusial administration, peri-articular administration and intra-articular administration. In a preferred embodiment, the FGF-18 compound described herein is administered peri-articularly (administration around a joint) or intrarticularly (administration within a joint). In an embodiment of the present invention, the periarticular or intraarticular administration is done around or in a joint selected from joint of the hip, knee, elbow, wrist, ankle, spine, feet, finger, toe, hand, shoulder, ribs, shoulder blades, thighs, shins, heels and along the bony points of the spine. In yet another preferred embodiment the periarticular or intraarticular administration is done around or in a the joint of the hip or the knee. Cartilage Disorders The present invention relates to methods of treating, preventing or ameliorating the symptoms of a cartilage disorder in a mammal. Preferably such cartilage disorder result from damages due to traumatic injury or chondropathy. It is understood that preferably humans are patients to be treated according to the present invention; however, it is understood that other mammals, including but not limited to dogs, horses and the like may be treated with methods according to the present invention. Examples of cartilage disorders that may be treated, prevented or ameliorated by the treatment described herein include but are not restricted to: arthritis, osteochondritis, costochondritis (such as Tietze'syndrome), osteomyelitis, polychondritis, relapsing polychondritis and Osteochondritis Dissecans. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is arthritis. Preferably, said disease is selected from the group consisting of: ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), gout, pseudogout, infectious arthritis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, scleroderma, Sj√∂gren's syndrome and Still's disease. In a preferred embodiment, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteoarthritis. Arthritis, relates to a damage to articular structures (joints) in the body and related inflammatory processes. Arthritis, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritic joints as a result of injury, and the like, are common inflammatory conditions which would benefit from the therapeutic use of FGF18 according to the present invention. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is arthritis involving the spine. It causes pain and stiffness in the back, and also a bent posture. This is a result of ongoing swelling and irritation of the spinal joints (vertebrae). In severe cases, inflammation of the vertebrae can eventually cause them to fuse together leading to severely limited mobility. Inflammation of the tendons and ligaments that connect and provide support to joints can lead to pain and tenderness in the ribs, shoulder blades, hips, thighs, shins, heels and along the bony points of the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory form of arthritis that affects the spinal joints. The hallmark feature of AS is the involvement of the joints at the base of the spine where the spine joins the pelvis‚Äîthe sacroiliac (SI) joints. The disease course is highly variable, and while some individuals have episodes of transient back pain only, others have more chronic severe back pain that leads to differing degrees of spinal stiffness over time. In almost all cases the disease is characterized by acute painful episodes and remissions (periods where the problem settles). Over the years AS has been known by many different names including poker back, rheumatoid spondylitis, and Marie-Strumpells spondylitis. Since the early 70s with increasing knowledge about the disease, there is almost universal use of the term ankylosing spondylitis. AS is a member of the family of diseases that attack the spine. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is characterized by excessive bone growth along the sides of the vertebrae of the spine. It also involves inflammation and bone growth where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, such as at the elbow, knee and the heel of the foot. Bone spurs are common among people with DISH. DISH (sometimes called Forestier's disease) is considered a form of degenerative arthritis and is characterized by excessive bone growth along the sides of the vertebrae of the spine. It is also associated with inflammation and calcification (bone growth) at other areas of the body where tendons and ligaments attach to bone, such as at the elbow, knee and the heel of the foot. These can lead to bone spurs. Heel spurs, for example, are common among people with DISH. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is gout. Gout is a type of arthritis in which uric acid, a waste product that occurs naturally occurring within the body, rises above normal levels. Rather than being flushed by the kidneys and through the urine, as it normally is, it forms crystals and deposits in the joints. These deposits give rise to inflammation of the joints, causing pain, swelling, redness and tenderness of the area. Most typically the joint affected is that of the big toe, but gout can also affect the ankle, knee, foot, hand, wrist and elbow. Uric acid crystals may also form deposits in other areas such as under the skin or in other soft tissues, and in the kidney or urinary tract. Gout typically affects the joint at the base of the big toe. In over half of all initial attacks, this is the first joint affected. Almost any other joint can be affected, but the joints of the lower limbs are more commonly than those of the upper limbs. The majority of initial gout attacks involve only one joint, and, with treatment, subside within three to ten days. Over 50% of people who have had an acute attack of gout will have a recurrence within the year. Over time the attacks may become more frequent, longer lasting and often involve more joints. For some people the attacks linger, and the disease becomes chronic. The crystals of uric acid deposited inside the joint and in the surrounding soft tissues lead to destructive changes in the joint and cause persistent inflammation. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is pseudogout. Pseudogout is a type of arthritis that is caused by the build up of calcium in the body. Pseudogout results from a build up of calcium crystals (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate) in a joint. The calcium forms crystals that deposit in the joints between bones. This causes swelling and pain in the area. The calcium deposits and chronic inflammation can cause parts of the joint structure to weaken and break down. With pseudogout cartilage can begin to crack and get holes in it and cause more pain and swelling in the joint. Over time the cartilage may wear away entirely, and the bones rub together. Much of the pain of pseudogout is a result of muscles and the other tissues that help joints move (such as tendons and ligaments) being forced to work in ways for which they were not designed, as a result of damage to the cartilage. Cartilage itself does not have nerve cells, and therefore cannot sense pain, but the muscles, tendons, ligaments and bones do. After many years of cartilage erosion, bones may actually rub together. This grinding of bone against bone adds further to the pain. Bones can also thicken and form growths, called spurs or osteophytes, which rub together. Like the disease gout, pseudogout can come on as sudden, recurrent attacks of pain and swelling in a single joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is infectious arthritis. Infectious arthritis causes pain and swelling in the joints. The inflammation is caused by a germ. The germ can be a bacterium, a virus, or a fungus. There is usually only one joint involved, though sometimes two or three joints can become infected. It does not usually last a long time if it is treated early. Mostly, infectious arthritis affects the large joints (shoulders, hips, knees), but smaller joints (fingers, ankles) can also be involved. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. It may be caused by the breakdown of cartilage. Bits of cartilage may break off and cause pain and swelling in the joint between bones. Over time the cartilage may wear away entirely, and the bones will rub together. Osteoarthritis can affect any joint but usually concerns hands and weight-bearing joints such as hips, knees, feet, and spine. The disease state of osteoarthritis (OA) is a complex, multi-factorial progressive disease that is non-inflammatory in nature and which is characterized by a general age-related degradation of articular cartilage in the joints. OA is also characterized by chondrocyte activation leading to cell proliferation and apoptosis, protease expression and abnormal matrix production, failed cartilage repair leading to loss of extracellular matrix, matrix calcification and osteophyte formation. The degradation of cartilage and extracellular matrix structures leads to increased friction between the bones and nerves of the affected joints. OA causes varying levels of pain and progressive debilitation in those afflicted with the disease. Current therapies for OA are palliative or surgical. In healthy joints cartilage acts as a shock absorber when weight is put on the joint. The slippery surface of the cartilage allows the bones to move smoothly. When a joint develops osteoarthritis the cartilage gradually becomes rough and thin, and the bone underneath thickens. Although there is usually no swelling in the early stage of the disease, as the arthritis progresses there can be inflammation. Bits of cartilage may break off and float around inside the joint. This disturbs other soft tissues inside the joint and can cause pain and swelling between bones. Over time as the cartilage wears down, the bones may form bumps on their ends. These bumps are called spurs. Or, the cartilage may wear away entirely, and bones may directly come in contact with each other. OA may lead to other problems such as: the muscles that hold the joint in place weaken because they are not being used, over time the joint looses its shape and does not work at all. OA commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as hips, knees, feet and spine. However, non-weight bearing joints such as finger joints and the joint at the base of the thumb may be affected as well. It usually does not affect other joints, except when they have been injured or been put under unusual stress. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease that mainly involves the synovial membrane of multiple joints with resultant injury to the articular cartilage. The pathogenesis is T lymphocyte dependent and is associated with the production of rheumatoid factors, auto-antibodies directed against self IgG, with the resultant formation of immune complexes that attain high levels in joint fluid and blood. These complexes in the joint may induce the marked infiltrate of lymphocytes and monocytes into the synovium and subsequent marked synovial changes; the joint space/fluid is infiltrated by similar cells with the addition of numerous neutrophils. Tissues affected are primarily the joints, often in symmetrical pattern. Inflammatory cells release enzymes that may digest bone and cartilage. As a result of rheumatoid arthritis, the inflamed joint lining, the synovium, can invade and damage bone and cartilage leading to joint deterioration and severe pain amongst other physiologic effects. The involved joint can lose its shape and alignment, resulting in pain and loss of movement. Therefore RA may lead to severe disability and increased mortality. Joint damage can occur even in cases where the pain is not severe. It can happen even in the early stages of the disease. For many people with RA, damage has shown up on X-rays of the hands and feet within two years of the onset of the disease. But it may be too late to treat by the time X-rays discover the problem. Severe damage can lead to permanent joint deformity and disability. Pain and swelling may cause difficulty walking. A variety of cytokines are produced locally in the rheumatoid joints. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IL-1 and TNF-alpha, two prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokines, play an important role in the mechanisms involved in synovial inflammation and in progressive joint destruction. Indeed, the administration of TNF-alpha and IL-1 inhibitors in patients with RA has led to a dramatic improvement of clinical and biological signs of inflammation and a reduction of radiological signs of bone erosion and cartilage destruction. However, despite these encouraging results, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to these agents, suggesting that other mediators are also involved in the pathophysiology of arthritis. One important way to distinguish RA from other forms of arthritis is by the pattern of joint involvement. For example, RA affects the wrist and many of the hand joints but usually not the joints that are most distal joints. In RA, the joints tend to be involved in a symmetrical pattern. That is, if the knuckles on the right hand are inflamed, the knuckles on the left hand are likely to be inflamed as well. Other joints commonly affected by RA include the elbows, shoulders, neck, jaw, feet, ankles, knees, and hips. Other than the neck, the spine usually is not directly affected by RA. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a condition that causes swelling and pain in and around the joints. It also causes a scaly rash on the skin. It can affect a number of joints including the fingers, wrists, toes, knees, ankles, elbows and shoulder joints, the spine and joints in the lower back (called sacroiliac joints). Psoriatic arthritis also affects tissues surrounding the joints including tendons and ligaments. It may cause swelling of a whole digit called ‚Äúsausage‚Äù finger or toe. There is also skin inflammation, particularly on the elbows, knees and scalp. Psoriatic arthritis is linked to psoriasis, a disorder causing areas of the skin to become inflamed and be covered with silvery or grey scales. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is reactive arthritis. Reactive arthritis refers to pain, stiffness, redness or swelling in a joint resulting from a previous infection. It most often occurs in the joints of the lower limbs (knees, ankles, toes), but can also occur in the upper limbs. Problems may be in the joints only or involve other body systems such as the eyes, skin muscles or tendons. When it affects areas besides the joints, reactive arthritis is then called Reiter's syndrome. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is scleroderma. Scleroderma is a condition where the skin gets thick and hard. There are two main types of scleroderma. One type is localized scleroderma, which affects mainly the skin. It can also involve the muscles and joints. The other type, generalized scleroderma, affects the skin as well as the internal organs, such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The most characteristic feature of scleroderma is the build-up of tough scar-like fibrous tissue in the skin. Less visible changes include damage to the cells lining the walls of small blood vessels. This may in turn damage major organs. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Sj√∂gren's syndrome. Sj√∂gren's syndrome is a chronic disorder that causes damage to the salivary glands resulting in dry mouth, and the tear glands, resulting in dry eyes. It can also affect other parts of the body including joints, muscles and nerves, organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, stomach and brain, or glands such as the thyroid gland. Sj√∂gren's syndrome can cause complete destruction of any of these areas. Since Sj√∂gren's syndrome can affect the liver and pancreas, there is a greater chance of developing cancer of the lymph tissue. However, this is an unusual and rare result. Sj√∂gren's syndrome can occur in two ways. It is ‚Äòsecondary‚Äô Sj√∂gren's syndrome when it occurs in people who have a rheumatic condition or connective tissue disease such as lupus, scleroderma or polymyositis. It is named ‚Äòprimary‚Äô Sj√∂gren's syndrome when dry eyes and mouth are not associated with a rheumatic condition. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Still's disease. Still's disease is a form of arthritis characterized by high spiking fevers, salmon-coloured rashes and inflammation of the joints. The disease is most common among children, for whom it is commonly referred to as systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Still's disease can also occur among adults, although much less commonly than for children. In this case it is referred to as adult-onset Still's disease or AOSD. As disclosed here above, cartilage disorders that may be treated, prevented or ameliorated by the treatment described herein include: Osteochondritis Dissecans, costochondritis (such as Tietze'syndrome), osteomyelitis, and relapsing polychondritis. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is Osteochondritis Dissecans. Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a term for osteochondral fracture. An osteochondral fragment may be present in situ, incompletely detached, or completely detached. OCD is a form of osteochondrosis limited to the articular epiphysis. Articular epiphyses fail as a result of compression. Both trauma and ischemia probably are involved in the pathology. Trauma is most likely the primary insult, with ischemia as secondary injury. Trauma may be caused by direct trauma, such as impaction fracture, or repetitive microtrauma, such as excessive normal compressive stress. The knee joint is the most commonly involved site. However, the elbow joint, the ankle joint, tarsal navicular, hip joint, shoulder joint, Glenoid, wrist joint may also be affected. OCD tends to affect young patients. In OCD of the elbow, patient age averages 23 years and ranges from 4-47 years. In the ankle, patient age averages 20 years and ranges from 8-50 years. In the hip, patient age averages 24 years and ranges from 14-39 years. Patients usually report pain at the extremes of motion range. Periarticular edema often is present with slight warmth to the touch. When a lower extremity is involved, patients often limp. Symptoms usually improve with protected immobilization of the joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is costochondritis. Costochondritis is an inflammation of the junctions where the upper ribs join with the cartilage that holds them to the breastbone or sternum. The cause is usually unknown. When the pain of costochondritis is accompanied by swelling it is referred to as Tietze's syndrome. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory process of the bone and its structures secondary to infection with pyogenic organisms. The infection associated with osteomyelitis may be localized or it may spread through the periosteum, cortex, marrow, and cancellous tissue. The bacterial pathogen varies on the basis of the patient's age and the mechanism of infection. Hematogenous osteomyelitis is an infection caused by bacterial seeding from the blood. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is characterized by an acute infection of the bone caused by the seeding of the bacteria within the bone from a remote source. This condition occurs primarily in children. The most common site is the rapidly growing and highly vascular metaphysis of growing bones. The apparent slowing or sludging of blood flow as the vessels make sharp angles at the distal metaphysis predisposes the vessels to thrombosis and the bone itself to localized necrosis and bacterial seeding. Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, despite its name, may have a slow clinical development and insidious onset. Direct or contiguous inoculation osteomyelitis is caused by direct contact of the tissue and bacteria during trauma or surgery. Direct inoculation (contiguous-focus) osteomyelitis is an infection in the bone secondary to the inoculation of organisms from direct trauma, spread from a contiguous focus of infection, or sepsis after a surgical procedure. Clinical manifestations of direct inoculation osteomyelitis are more localized than those of hematogenous osteomyelitis and tend to involve multiple organisms. Additional categories include chronic osteomyelitis and osteomyelitis secondary to peripheral vascular disease. Chronic osteomyelitis persists or recurs, regardless of its initial cause and/or mechanism and despite aggressive intervention. Although listed as an etiology, peripheral vascular disease is actually a predisposing factor rather than a true cause of infection. Disease states known to predispose patients to osteomyelitis include diabetes mellitus, sickle cell disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), IV drug abuse, alcoholism, chronic steroid use, immunosuppression, and chronic joint disease. In addition the presence of a prosthetic orthopedic device is an independent risk factor as is any recent orthopedic surgery or open fracture. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is relapsing polychondritis. Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an uncommon and severe episodic inflammatory condition involving cartilaginous structures, predominantly those of the ear, nose, and laryngotracheobronchial tree. Other affected structures may include the eye, cardiovascular system, peripheral joints, middle ear, and inner ear. The etiology of this disease is unknown; however, the pathogenesis is most likely autoimmune in nature. Evidence for an autoimmune etiology includes its clinical association with other autoimmune disorders, its association with the HLA-DR4 haplotype, pathology findings of infiltrating CD4 T cells and antigen-antibody complexes in the affected cartilage, cellular and humoral responses against collagen type II and other collagen antigens, and the observation that immunosuppressive regimens most often suppress the disease. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is cartilage damage resulting from a trauma. Cartilage injuries can occur as a result of traumatic mechanical destruction. A direct blow or other trauma can injure the cartilage. Cartilage has no direct blood supply, thus it has little capacity to repair itself. The methods of the present invention improve cartilage repair. Therefore in an embodiment of the present invention, cartilage damage resulting from a trauma is resulting from an accident or from surgery. In a particular embodiment of the present invention, cartilage damage resulting from a trauma is resulting from surgery, in particular orthopedic surgery or plastic surgery. Also considered by the present invention is the treatment of sport-related injury or sport-related wear of tissues of the joint. In an embodiment of the present invention, the cartilage disorder treated, prevented or ameliorated is an unaesthetic appearance disorder. In such an embodiment, the method and use of the present invention may be used in association to plastic surgery.

EXAMPLE 1 Disease Models in Animals and Extended Pharmacology In vivo, FGF-18(170AA) was tested in different disease models of OA and damaged cartilage, with significant therapeutic efficacy using an intra-articular (i.a.) dosing. Overall a therapeutically effective dose of 3-40 Œºg i.a. per animal/week was demonstrable in different species (rat, dog).

Dosing by the i.a. route was initiated 19-21 days after surgery at doses of 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 Œºg (formulated in saline) to determine pharmacodynamic effects related to the dosing regimen. These total doses were administered either as (i) single dose, (ii) once weekly (‚Öì of total dose per injection) for 3 weeks, or (iii) three times weekly for 3 weeks ( 1/9 of total dose per injection)( FIG. 1 ). At the conclusion of treatment or after 3 weeks post-treatment, right knees were collected for histopathology evaluation of potential effects. Evaluation of the lesions was performed in 3 different zones: regional differences across the medial tibial plateau were taken into consideration by dividing each section into 3 zones (1‚Äîoutside, 2‚Äîmiddle, 3‚Äîinside). In the surgical OA model, the outside (z1) and middle (z2) thirds are usually most severely affected, and milder changes are present on the inside third (z3). Experimental Design Animals (5-10/group), housed 2-3/cage, are anesthetized with Isoflurane and the right knee area is prepared for surgery. A skin incision is made over the medial aspect of the knee and the medial collateral ligament is exposed by blunt dissection, and then transected. The medial meniscus is cut through the full thickness to simulate a complete tear. Skin and subcutis are closed with 4-0 Vicryl suture using a subcuticular pattern. Dosing by the intra-articular route is initiated 19-21 days after surgery and is discontinued after a single dose or continued for 3 weeks with intra-articular injections once per week or 3 times per week. Rats are then terminated (g1-16) or allowed to recover for an additional 3 weeks prior to termination (g17-32). Four hours prior to necropsy, all rats are given 50 mg/kg BRDU to label actively proliferating cells. Blood is collected for serum just prior to necropsy and synovial lavage is done on the right knee. At necropsy, the right (operated) knee joint was trimmed of muscle and connective tissue and collected into 10% neutral buffered formalin. The patella is removed to allow proper fixation of the joints. Trachea, sternum, and ear samples are also placed in formalin. Results Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery Untreated Controls (Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery) Untreated animals with medial meniscal tear that were terminated at 6 weeks post surgery had tibial cartilage degeneration which was most severe on the outer ‚Öî of the tibial plateau and less severe on the inside ‚Öì. Osteophytes were large (mean 468 Œºm). Femoral cartilage degeneration was milder and more variable than tibial degeneration. Animals treated with saline once weekly had a significantly lower zone 3 total of tibial cartilage degeneration scores (16%), a significantly lower depth ratio (16%), and a significantly greater area of viable cartilage in the lateral tibia as compared to untreated animals (13%). Animals treated with saline 3 times weekly had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores in zone 2 of the tibia (24%), a significantly lower depth ratio (13%), and significantly greater area of viable cartilage in both the medial and lateral tibia (15 and 14%). These differences in the control groups are likely a result of repeated anesthesia events influencing overall activity of the animals, although the possibility that repeated saline injections influenced lesion severity by facilitating removal of mediators and debris cannot be ruled out. Single Dose Treatment (Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery) Animals given a single dose of 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had a significantly greater width of total cartilage degeneration (16%) due to an increase in proteoglycan loss in zone 3. Osteophyte scores and measurements were significantly increased (19 and 25%, respectively) in animals given a single dose of 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage matrix in the medial tibia was significantly increased by 27% in animals treated with 10 Œºg. Immunostaining revealed bromodeoxyuridine (BRDU) immunopositivity in fibrotic marrow subjacent to cartilage lesions and in bone marrow cells, fibroblasts, and osteophyte cartilage, with similar staining patterns in saline and FGF-18(170AA) treated joints. These results indicate that a single injection of 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had a definite anabolic effect, as evidenced by increased osteophyte size and increased medial tibial cartilage area. These changes were not, however, sufficient to improve the overall cartilage degeneration scores. It is likely that the increase in medial cartilage area is a result of increased cartilage thickness on the load bearing surface adjacent to the osteophyte. Once Weekly for 3 Weeks (Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery) Animals treated with 3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) once weekly had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores compared to the saline once weekly control in zone 2 of the medial tibia. Animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had significantly lower significant degeneration width (37%), and those given 3 Œºg (28%) or 1 Œºg (15%) also had some inhibition. Osteophyte scores and measurements were dose responsively and significantly increased by treatment with 10 (32 and 53%) or 3 (21 and 32%) Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage matrix in the medial tibia was significantly increased by treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (27%). Mild to marked chronic active synovitis with fibrosis was evident in joints injected with 10 or 3 Œºg and those injected with 1 Œºg had minimal synovitis. Subchondral bone resorption was minimally increased in a few joints treated with 10 Œºg. Animals treated with 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had increased BRDU labeling in the fibrotic marrow, synovium, and in areas of chondrogenesis or osteophytes, as compared to saline controls. These results demonstrated dose responsive benefit of treatment using the once weekly paradigm on the significant cartilage degeneration width. This parameter is most indicative of the presence of a viable matrix of some type within the defect area and, along with medial tibial cartilage areas, demonstrates the anabolic response. The BRDU labeling results indicate continued proliferative responses after cessation of dosing. Three Times Weekly for 3 Weeks (Evaluated at 6 Weeks Post Surgery) Treatment with 1, 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) administered as 3 injections per week resulted in a significant decrease in tibial cartilage degeneration scores compared to the 3 times weekly saline control in zone 1 (animals treated with 10 Œºg), zone 2 (1 or 3 Œºg), and the zone 3 total (1 or 3 Œºg). Treatment with 10 Œºg significantly increased the total tibial cartilage degeneration width by 24%. Treatment with 1 or 3 Œºg nonsignificantly decreased cartilage degeneration width by 24% and 21% respectively, indicating some beneficial effect. Animals treated with 1 or 3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) also had significantly lower depth ratios (17% and 18% respectively) than saline controls. The medial tibial osteophyte score was increased after treatment with 0.3, 1, 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (13%, 7%, 13% and 15% respectively), while all 4 doses (0.3, 1, 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA)) significantly increased the osteophyte measurement (12, 18, 60 and 62%, respectively. Treatment with 10 Œºg significantly increased the femoral cartilage degeneration score by 114%. Bone scores were significantly increased by treatment with 3 (60%) or 10 (88%) Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The total joint score without femur was significantly decreased by treatment with 3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (13%), but the addition of the femur to the total joint score eliminated that variation. Treatment with 1, 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased the area of viable cartilage in the medial tibia (13%, 29% and 29%), and treatment with 3 or 10 Œºg significantly increased area in the lateral tibia (22% and 13%). Joints injected with 3 or 10 Œºg had marked to severe synovitis with increased subchondral bone resorption and similar but mild to moderate changes were observed in joints treated with 1 Œºg. Animals treated with 1, 30 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had BRDU labeling in numerous areas including marrow, osteophytes, meniscus, synovium, and areas of chondrogenesis. These results demonstrated the most pronounced anabolic effects of any treatment paradigm, but were accompanied by severe synovial inflammation and increased subchondral bone resorption. Results Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery Untreated Controls (Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery) Untreated animals with medial meniscal tear that were terminated at 9 weeks had tibial cartilage degeneration which was most severe on the outer ‚Öî of the tibial plateau and less severe on the inside ‚Öì. Femoral cartilage degeneration was less severe and more variable. Scores were, in general, higher than in untreated animals terminated at week 6. Single dose saline controls had significantly lower cartilage degeneration scores in zone 2 of the tibia (12%) than those of the once weekly saline controls (18%). Single dose saline controls also had significantly greater width of moderate collagen degeneration (92%). Animals given saline once weekly had a significantly lower sum of severe, marked, moderate, and mild collagen degeneration (15%), as those of the 3 times weekly saline control animals (22%). These differences were relatively minor since there were only 5 rats in each of these groups and were a result of variation in disease progression in individuals. Single Dose (Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery, Incl. 3 Weeks Post-Treatment) There was no significant effect of treatment in any animals given a single dose of FGF-18(170AA) and terminated 9 weeks after surgery, although a few joints injected with 10 Œºg had evidence of anabolic response on the lateral tibia. Once Weekly for 3 Weeks (Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery, Incl. 3 Weeks Post-Treatment) After treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) once weekly, significant decreases in cartilage degeneration scores in zone 1 and zone 3 total of the medial tibia by 38 and 31% were observed. Treatment with 0.3 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly reduced scores in zone 2 compared to the once weekly saline control. Animals treated with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) had significantly lower significant cartilage degeneration width (38%). Depth ratios were significantly decreased by treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) (22%). Treatment with 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly and identically increased osteophyte scores (25%), but only animals given 10 Œºg had significantly increased osteophyte measurements (53%). There was a 23% significant decrease in total joint score with femur in animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA). The area of viable cartilage was significantly increased in animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) in both the medial (40%) and lateral (81%) tibia. Treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly reduced the width of severe and minimal collagen degeneration, as well as the width of severe, marked, and moderated degeneration combined and the width of severe and marked combined. Synovial inflammation was minimal in joints injected with 3 or 10 Œºg and absent at lower doses. Anabolic responses were evident in some or all joints injected with any dose. BRDU labeling was seen mainly in bone marrow and fibroblasts of saline controls and increased labeling (cartilage and osteophytes) was seen in joints injected with 10 Œºg. These results indicated that the cartilage repair/anabolic responses continued beyond the treatment period and that synovitis subsided, although osteophyte measures were comparable at 6 or 9 weeks in joints treated with this dose. Dose responsive benefit was seen using the significant cartilage degeneration parameter and severe matrix loss, as measured by collagen degeneration, was improved. Three Times Weekly for 3 Weeks (Evaluated at 9 Weeks Post Surgery, Incl. 3 Weeks Post-Treatment) The zone 3 total tibial cartilage degeneration score was significantly decreased by 38% in animals given 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) as 3 injections weekly, as compared to the 3 times weekly saline control. Treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) also significantly decreased the significant cartilage degeneration width (48%). The depth ratio was significantly decreased by 27% in animals treated with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA). Osteophyte measurements were significantly increased in animals treated with 3 (57%) or 10 (103%) Œºg FGF-18(170AA). Treatment with 1, 3, or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased the area of viable cartilage in the medial tibia (34%, 37% and 71% respectively), while treatment with 0.3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) significantly increased areas in the lateral tibia (46% and 67%). Mild collagen degeneration width was significantly increased in animals treated with 3 or 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA), as was the width of mild and minimal degeneration combined in animals given 10 Œºg. Mild synovitis was present in all joints injected with 10 Œºg (divided) and minimal to mild synovitis was present in those given 1 or 3 Œºg. Anabolic responses were evident from 1 Œºg upwards. BRDU labeling was seen mainly in bone marrow and fibroblasts of saline controls and increased labeling (cartilage and osteophytes) was seen in joints injected with 10 Œºg. These results indicated that the cartilage repair/anabolic responses continued beyond the treatment period and that synovitis subsided as compared to the 6 week time point. Beneficial effects on collagen loss were less clear, although there was a definite trend towards smaller measurements for the areas of marked to severe loss. EXAMPLE 1.2 Dog Menisectomy Model of OA Female beagle dogs (n=3/group) that had had unilateral partial medial menisectomy on the left knee one month prior to initiation of treatment were treated with saline or 3, 10, or 30 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) once, once weekly, or three times weekly (divided ‚Öì doses) for 3 weeks to determine beneficial effects on established OA. After 3 weeks of treatment, left knees were evaluated for effects on gross (n=3/group) and microscopic (n=3/group) changes induced by menisectomy and for evidence of anabolic effects. All dogs except one exhibited normal appetite and activity throughout the study. One dog (YLI-8) from group 12 died prior to termination (day 17) due to aspiration pneumonia associated with repeated anesthesia for joint injections. Typical degenerative changes characterized by the presence of focal, well circumscribed lesions of cartilage degeneration were present on the medial tibias of all operated dogs in all groups. Femoral lesions were sporadically observed. All dogs had minimal medial joint capsule thickening. Meniscal damage (approximately ¬Ω absent at necropsy with generally none to moderate repair) was similar in all groups. Microscopic evaluation revealed that untreated and vehicle treated knees often had cartilage hypertrophy with cloning in the zone 1 of levels 1 and 2. Definite anabolic effects (increased cloning, cellularity, and proteoglycan staining in lesion areas) were observed in knees treated with 30 Œºg (10 Œºg three times weekly) FGF-18(170AA), and these changes were most identifiable on femoral condyles. Lesser, but still convincing anabolic effects were observed in some knees treated 3 times weekly with the lower doses of FGF-18(170AA), or in knees treated with 30 or 10 Œºg once weekly. When present, these FGF-18(170AA) induced changes were generally in the upper ‚Öì to ¬Ω of the cartilage or in matrix adjacent to deeper clefts. Results of this study demonstrated definite anabolic effects of i.a. treatment with 10 Œºg FGF-18(170AA) 3 times weekly (30 Œºg total/week) in all knees and lesser effects in some knees treated with lower doses 3 times weekly or with 30 or 10 Œºg once weekly. The changes consisted of cloning, increased proteoglycan synthesis in the upper ‚Öì to ¬Ω of the cartilage or in matrix adjacent to clefts. Mild marginal zone proliferative changes were observed in some joints but there were no excessive changes similar to those occurring in rats. The anabolic changes in articular cartilage were greater than the anabolic changes in marginal zones in all cases. Collagen damage measurements also suggested some protection of matrix integrity. EXAMPLE 1.3 Dog Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) Model For investigations on severe progressive osteoarthritis, the dog anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) model is used for pre-clinical pharmacology investigations, including MRI evaluation at end of treatment and at follow up. This model provides efficacy data (histopathological and MRI over time and follow up) together with data on function by means of gait analysis. Using a non-invasive read-out MRI already at end of treatment a decrease in cartilage lesions compared to healthy baseline was demonstrable (‚àí13.3, ‚àí7.5, ‚àí9.3 and ‚àí8.8 for vehicle, 3 Œºg/joint, 10 Œºg/joint and 30 Œºg/joint, respectively). Also a functional improvement measured via gait analysis on force plate is demonstrable at end of therapy: Gait analysis was performed using a platform-based pressure/force measurement (Matscan¬Æ System, Tekscan Inc, Boston, Mass., USA). Gait Acquisition Procedures The Matscan¬Æ System comprises 4 walkway floor displays, each having 2,288 sensing elements included in a sensing area of 432 mm√ó368 mm, producing a spatial resolution of 1.4 sensels/cm2. This device was calibrated with a predefined weight at the beginning of the study and the same calibration was used for all dogs throughout the study. For the osteoarthritis-induced hind limb, the peak vertical force and the contact area were acquired at a trotting gait velocity ranging from 1.9 to 2.2 meters/second. Velocity was ensured using a chronometer. The gait acquisition window was 3 seconds with a sampling rate set at 44 hertz, producing a total of 132 frames. The first 5 valid trials were obtained for each dog and then averaged to characterize the dog profile at a given point in time. The peak vertical force was expressed in percentage of body weight (% BW) and the contact area was expressed in square centimeters (cm2). With regard to the peak vertical force of the osteoarthritis-induced hind limb acquired at the trot, the canine osteoarthritis model produced an abnormal gait (week 4) discernable over pre-operative values (baseline). The peak vertical force and the contact area were decreased 4 and 8 weeks following surgery as negative changes were observed in all groups (Tables 3 & 4). There was however a trend for dogs in Group IV at 8 weeks following surgery to have a less severe decrease compared to baseline vis-√†-vis the other groups.

A comparable value was obtained taking into account the whole articulation without synovial fluid (16 hours). Overall, the results indicated that the total radioactivity distributed outside the synovial fluid into the tissues of the knee articulation. The results obtained after autoradioluminography analysis of the treated knee joints shown that most of the radioactivity was localized in close proximity to the articulation. The results of whole body autoradioluminography analyses after intravenous administration and intra-articular administration of [ 3 H]-FGF18 are reported in table 8 and in table 9, respectively.

The measured half live in serum was about 55 hours. After intra-articular administration the means of total radioactivity increased slowly reaching the highest concentration at 24 and 48 hours after administration, in serum and blood, respectively. The systemic exposure was approximately 20% of that found after intravenous administration. Total radioactivity in serum was on average higher than that in blood, suggesting that the parent compound and/or its metabolites had low affinity for blood cells and circulating radioactivity was mainly distributed in serum. The levels of total radioactivity in the treated articulation declined bi-phasically with a terminal half-life of 20 hours. Overall, the results indicated that the total radioactivity distributed outside the synovial fluid into the knee articulation. Overall, based on the non-clinical pharmacology models in rat and dog, it is found that a particularly appropriate dosing regimen is once weekly for three weeks. The effective dose observed varies from 3-30 Œºg/joint.
