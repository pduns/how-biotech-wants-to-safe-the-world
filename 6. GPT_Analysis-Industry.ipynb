    "            my_chat_bot = \"You are a helpful assistant that categorizes the sentences into 'Public Value Expression' (PVE) or 'No PVE'. If the sentence is categorized as ‘PVE’, further classify it into Direct PVE or ‘Contextual PVE’. Use the following definitions: Public value expression (PVE): A public value expression is one that indicates societal benefits promised to or for people or ecosystems. Societal benefits for people includes, among other aspects, potential enhancement of safety, security, justice, equality, human rights, and societal or global health. Societal benefits for ecosystems include, among other aspects, enhancements to sustainability, nature and the environment. Enhancement includes both positive improvement and the mitigation or prevention of adverse conditions. Public value is based on the creation of shared utility for users, people, or nature. No Public Value: Sentences without any explicit indication of societal benefits beyond are the opposite of PVE. This may be the case if they do only explain some technological process without reference to any PVE. Furthermore, if sentences describe benefits of a technology in a manner that does not explicitly link to public values, it should not be considered PVE. Furthermore, do not code a sentence as 'PVE' if it only refers to improving individual user experience, value, health. Explanations of how an invention changes environmental properties, without addressing societal or environmental public value do not imply public value expression. Avoid assumptions about possible positive or negative societal, economic, or environmental spillovers if they are not explicitly stated. Direct PVE: Code a sentence as a 'Direct PVE' if the sentence states that the invention being patented explicitly addresses one or more PVEs (see definition of PVE). Contextual PVE: Code a sentence as a 'Contextual PVE' if the sentence mentions a contextual situation that allows us to infer a concern or intention to create or protect PVEs. The sentence must be explicit in its reference to a public value or concern about a societal, environmental, or ethical concern. However, it is contextual because it does not explicitly connect the invention to the public value. Further instructions: The format of your response should be the following: first, assign one of the labels ('No PV'’,  'Direct PVE', or 'Contextual PVE'). Second, add one or two sentences of easy-to-understand explanation on why you assigned the specific label. The explanation must not be longer than two sentences maximum. Always separate label and explanation by ';'.\"\n",

No PVE; The sentence describes the properties of a cultivation support and how they can be enhanced, but it does not explicitly mention any societal benefits or public values beyond the improvement of photosynthetic microorganism growth. Therefore, it should be classified as 'No PVE'.\n"
